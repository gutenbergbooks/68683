<p><i>The nineteen men of letters whose work is reviewed
in this volume represent an important half-century
of our national literary life. The starting-point
is the year 1809, the date of “A History
of New York by Diedrich Knickerbocker.” No
author is included whose reputation does not rest, in
part, on some notable book published before 1860.</i></p>

<p><i>Readers of modern French criticism will not
need to be told that the plan of dividing the studies
into short sections was taken from Faguet’s admirable
“Dix-Septième Siècle.”</i></p>

<p><i>I am indebted for many helpful criticisms to
Mr. James R. Joy, to Miss Mary Charlotte
Priest, and especially to Mr. Lindsay Swift of
the Boston Public Library.</i></p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Scotch</span> and English blood flowed in Washington
Irving’s veins. His father, William Irving
(whose ancestry has been traced by genealogical
enthusiasts to De Irwyn, armor-bearer to Robert
Bruce), was a native of Shapinsha, one of the Orkney
Islands; his mother, Sarah (Sanders) Irving,
came from Falmouth.</p>

<p>At the time of his marriage William Irving was
a petty officer on an armed packet-ship plying between
Falmouth and New York. Two years later
(1763) he gave up seafaring, settled in New York,
and started a mercantile business. He enjoyed a
competency, but like other patriotic citizens suffered
from the demoralization of trade during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
Revolution. His character suggested that of the
old Scotch covenanter. Though not without tenderness,
he was in the main strict and puritanical.</p>

<p>Washington Irving was born in New York on
April 3, 1783. He was the youngest of a family
of eleven, five of whom died in childhood. Irving
could perfectly remember the great patriot for
whom he was named. He was much indebted to
the good old Scotchwoman, his nurse, who, seeing
Washington enter a shop on Broadway, darted
in after him and presented her small charge with
‘Please your Excellency, here’s a bairn that’s
called after ye!’ ‘General Washington,’ said Irving,
recounting the incident in after years, ‘then
turned his benevolent face full upon me, smiled,
laid his hand on my head, and gave me his blessing....
I was but five years old, yet I can feel
that hand upon my head even now.’</p>

<p>Up to the age of fifteen Irving attended such
schools as New York afforded. He was not precocious.
He came home from school one day (he
was then about eight) and remarked to his mother:
‘The madame says I am a dunce; isn’t it a pity?’</p>

<p>Two of his brothers had been sent to Columbia
College; that he was not, may be attributed partly
to ill health, partly to an indolent waywardness
of disposition and to the indulgence so often
granted the youngest member of a large family.
Always an inveterate reader, he contrived in time
to educate himself by methods unapproved of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
pedagogical science. He decided on a legal career
and entered the office of a well-known practitioner,
Henry Masterton. During the two years he was
there he acquired some law and attained ‘considerable
proficiency in belles-lettres.’ He studied
for a time with Brockholst Livingston (afterwards
judge of the Supreme Court), and later with Josiah
Ogden Hoffman.</p>

<p>As a boy Irving had always ‘scribbled’ more or
less, and in 1802 he scribbled to some purpose,
contributing the ‘Jonathan Oldstyle’ letters to the
‘Morning Chronicle,’ a paper founded and edited
by his brother Peter Irving. His ambitions seemed
likely to be frustrated by poor health, and a trip
abroad was advised. He went to the Mediterranean,
visited Italy, and spent a little time in
France and England. The journey was not without
adventures. He saw Nelson’s fleet on its way
to Trafalgar; his boat was overhauled by pirates
near Elba; and in Rome he met Madame de Staël,
who almost overpowered him by her amazing volubility
and the pertinacity of her questioning.</p>

<p>On his return home Irving passed his examinations
(November, 1806), and was admitted to the
bar with but slender legal outfit, as he frankly confessed.
He was enrolled among the counsel for the
defence at the trial of Aaron Burr at Richmond.
There was no thought of taxing his untried legal
skill; he was to be useful to the cause as a writer in
case his services were needed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>Law gave place to literature. Irving and J. K.
Paulding projected a paper, <i>Salmagundi</i>, to be
‘mainly characterized by a spirit of fun and sarcastic
drollery.’ William T. Irving joined in the
venture. The first number appeared on January
24, 1807. The editors issued it when they were
so minded, and after publishing twenty numbers,
brought it to an almost unceremonious close.</p>

<p>The following year Peter and Washington Irving
began writing a burlesque account of their
native town, a parody on Mitchill’s <i>A Picture of
New York</i>. Peter was called to Liverpool to take
charge of the English interests of Irving and Smith,
and it fell to Washington to recast the chapters
already written and complete the narrative. The
book outgrew the design (as is the tendency of
parodies), and was published on December 6, 1809,
as <i>A History of New York from the Beginning of the
World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrich
Knickerbocker</i>. It was received by the New York
Historical Society, to whom it was dedicated, with
astonishment, and by the old Dutch families with
mingled emotions, among which that of exuberant
delight was not in every case the most prominent.</p>

<p>For two years Irving conducted the ‘Analectic
Magazine,’ published in Philadelphia. During the
exciting months which followed the British attack
on Washington (August, 1814), he was military
secretary to the governor of New York. Being of
adventurous spirit, he welcomed with joy the prospect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
of accompanying his friend Stephen Decatur
on the expedition to Algiers. Disappointed in this
and unable to get the fever of travel out of his
blood, he sailed for England (May, 1815), intending
nothing more than a visit to his brother in
Liverpool and to a married sister in Birmingham.</p>

<p>Peter Irving had been ill, and in consequence
his affairs had fallen into disorder. Washington
undertook to disentangle them. He was unsuccessful.
To the intense mortification of the brothers
they were compelled to go into bankruptcy
(1818), and Washington began casting about for
a way to supplement his slender income. He
refused an advantageous offer at home, and determined
to remain in England. A literary project
had taken shape in his mind, and he proceeded to
carry it out.</p>

<p>In May, 1819, Irving published the first part of
<i>The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon</i>, containing five
papers, one of which, ‘Rip Van Winkle,’ is a little
masterpiece. The attitude of the public towards
this venture convinced Irving that he might live
by the profession of letters. <i>The Sketch Book</i> was
followed by <i>Bracebridge Hall, or the Humorists</i>
(1822), and by the <i>Tales of a Traveller</i> (1824).
This last date marks a period in Irving’s literary
life.</p>

<p>The years which Irving spent abroad had their
anxieties, their depressions, their dull days, their
long periods of drudgery. It is a temptation to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
dwell on their pleasures and their triumphs. Irving
was fortunate in his friendships. He knew
Scott, Campbell, Moore, and Jeffrey, and had the
amusement on one occasion of seeing his visiting
list revised by Rogers. He met Mrs. Siddons,
marvelled at Belzoni, was amused by the antics
of Lady Caroline Lamb, breakfasted at Holland
House, and visited Thomas Hope at his country
seat. In Paris he was presented to Talma by John
Howard Payne, ‘the young American Roscius of
former days,’ who had now ‘outgrown all tragic
symmetry.’ He became (in time) persona gratissima
to John Murray, his English publisher; and
to be dear to one’s publisher must always be accounted
among the great rewards of literature.</p>

<p>At the instance of Alexander Everett, the
American Minister to Spain, Irving, in February,
1826, went to Madrid to translate Navarrete’s
forthcoming collection of documents relating to
Columbus. He presently abandoned the plan for
a more grateful task, the writing of an independent
account of the discovery of America, based
on Navarrete, and on ample materials supplied by
the library of Rich, the American consul at Madrid.
To this he devoted himself with immense energy.
The work was published in 1828, and was soon
followed by the <i>Conquest of Granada</i> and <i>Voyages
of the Companions of Columbus</i>.</p>

<p>In 1829 Irving became Secretary of the American
Legation in London. The Royal Society of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Literature voted him one of their fifty guinea gold
medals, in recognition of his services to the study
of history. The honor, distinguished in itself,
became doubly so to the recipient because the
other of the two awards for that year was bestowed
on Hallam. In June, 1830, the University of
Oxford conferred on Irving the degree of LL. D.
In April, 1832, he sailed for America. He had
been absent seventeen years.</p>

<p>After travels in various parts of the United
States, including a long journey to the far West
with the commissioner to the Indian tribes, Irving
settled near Tarrytown. His home was a little
Dutch cottage ‘all made up of gable ends, and
as full of angles and corners as an old cocked
hat.’ Familiarly called ‘The Roost’ by its inmates,
this ‘doughty and valorous little pile’ is
known to the world as ‘Sunnyside.’ With the
exception of the four years (1842–46) he passed
in Spain as Minister Plenipotentiary, ‘Sunnyside’
was Irving’s abiding-place until his death.</p>

<p>His later writings are: <i>The Alhambra</i>, 1832;
<i>The Crayon Miscellany</i> (comprising <i>A Tour on the
Prairies</i>, <i>Abbotsford and Newstead Abbey</i>, and
<i>Legends of the Conquest of Spain</i>), 1835; <i>Astoria</i>
(with Pierre M. Irving), 1836; <i>Adventures of
Captain Bonneville, U. S. A.</i> (edited), 1837; <i>Life
of Goldsmith</i>, 1849; <i>Mahomet and his Successors</i>,
1849–50; <i>The Chronicles of Wolfert’s Roost</i>, 1855;
<i>The Life of Washington</i>, 1855–59.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>Attempts were made to draw Irving into political
life. He was offered a nomination for Congress;
Tammany Hall ‘unanimously and vociferously’
declared him its candidate for mayor of New York;
and President Van Buren would have made him
Secretary of the Navy. All these honors he felt
himself obliged to refuse. He accepted the Spanish
mission (offered by President Tyler at the
instance of his Secretary of State, Daniel Webster),
because he believed himself not wholly unfitted
for the charge, and because it honored in him the
profession of letters.</p>

<p>Irving’s intellectual powers were at perfect command
up to the beginning of the last year of his
life. Then his health began to fail markedly, and
the final volume of his <i>Washington</i> cost him effort
he could ill afford. He died suddenly on November
28, 1859, and was buried in the cemetery at
Sleepy Hollow.</p>

<h3 id="sec_2">II<br />

<span class="subhead">IRVING’S CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Irving</span> was broad-minded, tolerant, amiable, incapable
of envy, quick to forget an affront, and
always willing to think the best of humanity. His
tactfulness was due in part to his large experience
of life, but more to the possession of a nature that
was sweet, serene, frank, and unsophisticated. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Irving was no courtier; he could as little flatter
as practise the more odious forms of deceit. His
gifts of irony and ridicule, supplemented with
an extraordinary power of humorous delineation,
were never abused. It might be said of him, as
of another great satirist, that ‘he never inflicted a
wound.’</p>

<p>His modesty was excessive. It is impossible to
find in his writings or his correspondence any hint
that he was inclined to put unusual value on his
work. Grateful as he was for praise, it would never
have occurred to him that he had a right to it.
With all his knowledge of the world he was singularly
diffident. Moore hit off this trait when he
said that Geoffrey Crayon was ‘not strong as a
lion, but delightful as a domestic animal.’</p>

<p>Not his least admirable virtue was a spirit of
helpfulness where his brother authors were concerned.
Irving was ‘officious’ in the good old
sense of the word, glad to be of service to his fellows,
untiring in efforts to promote their welfare.
He could praise their work, too, without disheartening
qualifications. The good he enjoyed, the
bad he put to one side. And he never forgot a
kindness. A publisher who had once befriended
him, though fallen on evil days, found himself still
able to command some of Irving’s best manuscripts.</p>

<p>Criticism never angered Irving. Personal attacks
(of which he had his share) were suffered with quiet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
dignity. He rarely defended himself, and then only
when the attack was outrageous. He could speak
pointedly if the need were. His reply to William
Leggett, who accused him in ‘The Plain Dealer’
of ‘literary pusillanimity’ and double dealing, is
a model of effectiveness. One paragraph will show
its quality. Imputing no malevolence to Leggett,
who doubtless acted from honest feelings hastily
excited by a misapprehension of the facts, Irving
says: ‘You have been a little too eager to give an
instance of that “plain dealing” which you have
recently adopted as your war-cry. Plain dealing,
sir, is a great merit when accompanied by magnanimity,
and exercised with a just and generous
spirit; but if pushed too far, and made the excuse
for indulging every impulse of passion or
prejudice, it may render a man, especially in your
situation, a very offensive, if not a very mischievous
member of the community.’</p>

<p>Something may be known of a man by observing
his attitude at the approach of old age. Irving’s
beautiful serenity was characteristic. People were
kind to him, but he thought their kindness extraordinary.
He wondered whether old gentlemen were
becoming fashionable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_3">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WRITER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Irving’s</span> prose is distinguished for grace and sweetness.
It is unostentatious, natural, easy. At its
best it comes near to being a model of good prose.
The most striking effects are produced by the simplest
means. Never does the writer appear to be
searching for an out-of-the-way term. He accepts
what lies at hand. The word in question is almost
obvious and often conventional, but invariably apt.</p>

<p>For a writer who produced so much the style is
remarkably homogeneous. It is an exaggeration to
speak of it as overcharged with color. There are
passages of much splendor, but Irving’s taste was
too refined to admit of his indulging in rhetorical
excesses. Nor is the style quite so mellifluous as
it seemed to J. W. Croker, who said: ‘I can no
more go on all day with one of his [Irving’s]
books than I could go on all day sucking a sugar-plum.’
The truth is that Irving is one of the
most human and companionable of writers, and his
English is just the sort to prompt one to go on all
day with him.</p>

<p>Yet there is a want of ruggedness, the style is almost
too perfectly controlled. It lacks the strength
and energy born of deep thought and passionate
conviction, and it must be praised (as it may be
without reserve) for urbanity and masculine grace.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> dignified appearance of Diedrich Knickerbocker’s
learned work, the quiet simplicity of the
principal title, and the sober dedication gave no
hint to the serious-minded that they were buying
one of the most extraordinary books of humor in
the English language. The deception could not
last long, but it is to be hoped that on the day
of publication some honest seeker after knowledge
took a copy home with the intent to profit at once
by its stores of erudition.</p>

<p>On a basis of historical truth Irving reared a delightfully
grotesque historical edifice. The method
is analogous to that children employ when they
put a candle on the floor that they may laugh at
the odd shadows of themselves cast on wall and
ceiling. The figures are monstrous, distorted, yet
always resembling. Nothing could be at once
more lifelike and more unreal than Irving’s account
of New Amsterdam and its people under
the three Dutch governors.</p>

<p>Here is a world of amusement to be had for the
asking. One reader will enjoy the ironical philosophy,
another the sly thrusts at current politics,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
a third the boisterous fun of certain episodes,
such as the fight between stout Risingh and Peter
Stuyvesant, the hint of which may have been
caught from Fielding’s account of how Molly Seagrim
valorously put her enemies to flight. But the
book will always be most cherished for its quaint
pictures of snug and drowsy comfort, for its world
of broad-bottomed burghers, amphibious housewives,
and demure Dutch damsels wooed by inarticulate
lovers smoking long pipes, and for the
rich Indian summer atmosphere with which the
poet-humorist invested the scenes of a not wholly
idyllic past.</p>

<p><i>The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon</i> is in one respect
well named; it has the heterogeneous character
that we associate with an artist’s portfolio.
Notes of travel, stories, meditations, and portraits
are thrown together in pleasant disorder. A paper
on ‘Roscoe’ is followed by the sketch entitled
‘The Wife,’ and the history of ‘Rip Van Winkle’
is succeeded by an essay on the attitude of English
writers towards America. In another sense the
volume is not a mere sketch-book, for each sketch
is a highly finished picture. Here is often a self-consciousness
radically unlike the abandon of the
<i>History of New York</i>. At times Irving falls quite
into the ‘Keepsake’ manner. A faint aroma as of
withered rose leaves steals from the pages, a languid
atmosphere of sweet melancholy dear to the
early Nineteenth Century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>Other pages are breezy enough. The five chapters
on Christmas at Bracebridge Hall, the essay
on ‘Little Britain,’ on the ‘Mutability of Literature,’
and that on ‘John Bull’ are emphatically
not in the ‘Keepsake’ vein. Of themselves they
would have sufficed to redeem <i>The Sketch Book</i>
from the worst charge that can be brought against
a piece of literature,—the charge of being merely
fashionable. But the extraordinary vitality which
this book has enjoyed for eighty-five years it owes
in the main to ‘Rip Van Winkle’ and ‘The Legend
of Sleepy Hollow.’ Written in small form,
embodying simple incidents, saturated with humor,
classic in their conciseness of style, these stories are
faultless examples of Irving’s art.</p>

<p>Irving dearly loved a lovable vagabond, and
Rip is his ideal. The story is told in a succession
of pictures. The reader visualizes scenery, character,
incident, the purple mountains, the village
nestling at their feet, the ne’er-do-weel whom
children love, the termagant wife, the junto before
the inn door, the journey into the mountains, the
strange little beings at their solemn game, the
draught of the fatal liquor, the sleep, the awakening,
the return home, the bewilderment, the recognition,—do
we not know it by heart? Have we
not read the narrative a hundred times, trying in
vain to penetrate the secret of its perfection?
Something of the logic of poetry went into the
creation of this idyl. We are left with the feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
that Irving himself could not have changed a
word for the better.</p>

<p>‘The Legend of Sleepy Hollow’ is etched with
a deeper stroke, is broader, more farcical. There
is no pathos, but downright fun and frolic from
the first line to the last. The audacious exaggeration
of every feature in the portrait of Ichabod
Crane is inimitably clever. The schoolmaster gets
no pity and needs none. And the reader is justified
in his unsympathetic attitude when later he
learns that Ichabod, instead of having been carried
off by the headless Hessian, merely changed
his quarters, and when last heard of had studied
law, written for the newspapers, and gone into
politics.</p>

<p>In <i>Bracebridge Hall</i> Geoffrey Crayon returns
to the English country house where he had spent
a Christmas, to enjoy at leisure old manners, old
customs, old-world ideas and people. Never were
simpler materials used in the making of a book;
never was a more entertaining book compounded
of such simple materials. The incidents are of the
most quiet sort, a walk, a dinner, a visit to a neighboring
grange or to a camp of gypsies, a reading
in the library or the telling of a story after dinner.
The philosophy is naïve, but the humor is exquisite
and unflagging.</p>

<p>The reader meets his old friends, the Squire,
Master Simon, old Christy, and the Oxonian.
New characters are introduced, Lady Lillycraft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
and General Harbottle, Ready-money Jack,
Slingsby the schoolmaster, and the Radical who
reads Cobbett, and goes armed with pamphlets
and arguments. Among them all none is more
attractive than the Squire. With his scorn of
commercialism, his love of ancient customs, his
good-humored tolerance of gypsies and poachers,
with his body of maxims from Peacham and other
old writers, and his amusing contempt for Lord
Chesterfield—these and other delightful traits
make Mr. Bracebridge one of the most ingratiating
characters in fiction.</p>

<p><i>Bracebridge Hall</i> contains interpolated stories,
the ‘Stout Gentleman,’ the ‘Student of Salamanca,’
and the finely finished tale of ‘Annette Delabarre.’
The papers of Diedrich Knickerbocker are not
yet exhausted; having furnished Rip and Ichabod
to <i>The Sketch Book</i> they now contribute to <i>Bracebridge
Hall</i> the story of ‘Dolph Heyliger.’</p>

<p>The <i>Tales of a Traveller</i>, a medley of episodes
and sketches, is divided into four parts. In the
first part the Nervous Gentleman of Bracebridge
Hall continues his narrations. These adventures,
supposed to have been told at a hunt dinner, or
at breakfast the following morning, are intertwined,
Arabian Nights fashion, story within story. They
are grotesque (the ‘Bold Dragoon,’ with the
richly humorous account of the dance of the furniture),
or weird and ghastly (the ‘German Student’),
or romantic (the ‘Young Italian’).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>The second part, ‘Buckthorne and his Friends,’
displays the seamy side of English dramatic and
literary life. Modern realism had not yet been
invented, and it is easy to laugh over the sorrows
of Flimsy, who, in his coat of Lord Townley cut
and dingy-white stockinet pantaloons, bears a
closer relation to Mr. Vincent Crummles than to
any one of the characters of <i>A Mummer’s Wife</i>.</p>

<p>Part third, the ‘Italian Banditti,’ is in a style
which no longer interests, though many worse
written narratives do. But in the last part, ‘The
Money-Diggers,’ Irving comes back to his own.
He is again wandering along the shores of the
pleasant island of Mannahatta, fishing at Hellegat,
lying under the trees at Corlear Hook while
a Cape Cod whaler tells the story of ‘The Devil
and Tom Walker.’ Ramm Rapelye fills his chair
at the club and smokes and grunts, ever maintaining
a mastiff-like gravity. Once more we see the
little old city which had not entirely lost its picturesque
Dutch features. Here stands Wolfert
Webber’s house, with its gable end of yellow
brick turned toward the street. ‘The gigantic sunflowers
loll their broad jolly faces over the fences,
seeming to ogle most affectionately the passers-by.’
Dirk Waldron, ‘the son of four fathers,’ sits
in Webber’s kitchen, feasting his eyes on the opulent
charms of Amy. He says nothing, but at
intervals fills the old cabbage-grower’s pipe, strokes
the tortoise-shell cat, or replenishes the teapot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
from the bright copper kettle singing before the
fire. ‘All these quiet little offices may seem of
trifling import; but when true love is translated
into Low Dutch, it is in this way it eloquently
expresses itself.’</p>

<p>Had Irving’s reputation depended on the four
books just now characterized, it would have been
a great reputation and the note of originality precisely
what we now find it. But there was need
of work in other fields to show the catholicity of
his interests and the range of his powers.</p>

<h3 id="sec_5">V<br />

<span class="subhead">HISTORICAL WRITINGS</span>

<span class="subhead"><i>COLUMBUS</i>, <i>CONQUEST OF GRANADA</i>,
<i>MAHOMET</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> <i>Life and Voyages of Columbus</i> is written in
the spirit of tempered hero-worship. It is free
from the extravagance of partisans who make a
god of Columbus, and from the skeptical cavillings
of those who apparently are not unwilling
to rob the great explorer of any claim he may
possess to virtue or ability. As Irving conceives
him, Columbus is a many-sided man, infinitely
patient when patience is required, doggedly obstinate
if the need be, crafty or open, daring in the
highest degree, having that audacity which seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
to quell the powers of nature, yet devout, with a
touch of the superstition characteristic of his time
and his belief.</p>

<p>On many questions, fine points of ethnography,
geography, navigation and the like, Irving neither
could nor did he presume to speak finally. History
has to be rewritten every few years wherever
these questions are involved. But the letters of
Columbus, the testimony of his contemporaries,
the reports of friend and enemy, throw an unchanging
light on character. The march of science
can neither dim nor augment that light. Irving
was emphatically a judge of human nature. He
needed no help in making up his mind what sort
of man Columbus was. Modern scholars with
their magnificent scientific equipment sometimes
forget that cartography, invaluable though it is, is
after all a poor guide to character. And yet, by the
testimony of one of those same modern scholars,
Irving’s life of the Admiral, as a trustworthy and
popular résumé, is still the best.</p>

<p>One often wishes Irving had been less temperate.
The barbarous tyranny of the Spaniards over
the Indians of Hispaniola stirs the reader to deepest
indignation. He longs for such treatment of
the theme as Carlyle might possibly have given.
Here is need of thunderbolts of wrath like unto
those wielded by the Jupiter Tonans of history.
But taken as a whole, the book has extraordinary
virtues. It is a clear, full, well-ordered, picturesque,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
and readable narrative of the great explorer’s
career. There is no better, nor is there likely to
be a better. He who has time to read but one book
on the discoverer of America will not go amiss in
reading this one. He who proposes to read many
books on the subject may well elect to read Irving’s
first.</p>

<p>The supplementary <i>Voyages of the Companions of
Columbus</i> narrates the adventures of Ojeda, that
dare-devil of the high seas, of Nicuesa, of Vasco
Nuñez, of Ponce de Leon. Though wanting the
unity of the preceding volumes, these narratives
are of high interest, and for vigor, animation, and
picturesqueness must rank among the most attractive
examples of Irving’s work.</p>

<p>While making collateral studies bearing on the
life of Columbus, Irving became so captivated with
the romantic and chivalrous story of the fall of
Granada that he found himself unable to complete
his more sober task until he had sketched a rough
outline of the new book. When the <i>Columbus</i> was
sent to the press, Irving made a tour of Andalusia,
visited certain memorable scenes of the war, and
on his return to Seville elaborated his sketch
into the ornate and glowing picture known as <i>A
Chronicle of the Conquest of Granada, by Fray Antonio
Agapida</i>.</p>

<p>The book is commonly described as romance
rather than history. It was written with a view to
rescuing the ancient chronicle of the conquest from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
the mass of amatory and sentimental tradition with
which it was incrusted, and of presenting it in its
legitimate brilliancy. Irving believed, too, that the
world had forgotten or had failed to realize how
stern the conflict was. In the fifteenth century it
was regarded as a Holy War. Christian bigot was
arrayed against Moslem bigot. Atrocities of the
blackest sort were perpetrated and justified in the
name of religion. The title-page says that the narrative
is taken from the manuscript of one Fray
Antonio Agapida. The brother is an imaginary
character, a personification of monkish zeal and intolerance.
When the slaughter of the infidels has
been unusually great, Fray Antonio makes his appearance,
like the ‘chorus’ of a play, and thanks
God with much unction. Through this mouth-piece
Irving gives ironical voice to that sentiment
it is impossible not to feel in contemplating the
barbarities of a ‘holy’ war. A few readers were
disturbed by the fiction of the old monk. They
ought to have liked him. He is an amusing personage
and comes too seldom on the stage.</p>

<p>The <i>Life of Mahomet and his Successors</i> has been
spoken of as ‘comparatively a failure.’ If a book
which sums up the available knowledge of the
time on the subject, which is written in clear, pure
English, which is throughout of high interest, in
other words, which has solidity, beauty, and a large
measure of the literary quality—if such a book is
comparatively a failure, one hardly knows what can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
be the critic’s standard of measurement. Irving
was not acquainted with Arabic. He drew his
materials from Spanish and German sources. Yet
it is not too much to say that no better general
account of Mahomet and the early caliphs has been
written.</p>

<h3 id="sec_6">VI<br />

<span class="subhead">SPANISH ROMANCE</span>

<span class="subhead"><i>THE ALHAMBRA</i>, <i>LEGENDS OF THE CONQUEST
OF SPAIN</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">For</span> three or four months Irving lived in the ancient
Moorish palace and fortress known as the
Alhambra. In his own phrase he ‘succeeded to
the throne of Boabdil.’ The place charmed him
beyond all others in the Old World. His craving
for antiquity, his love of the exotic, his passion for
romance, his delight in day-dreaming were here
completely satisfied. He loved the huge pile, so
rough and forbidding without, so graceful and
attractive within. The splendor of its storied past
intoxicated him. He roamed at will through its
courts and halls, steeping himself in history and
tradition. He was amused at the life of the petty
human creatures, nesting bird-like in the crannies
and nooks of the vast edifice. To observe their
habits, record their superstitious fancies, listen to
their tales, sympathize with their ambitions or their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
sorrows, was occupation enough. The history of
the place could be studied in the parchment-clad
folios of the Jesuit library. As for the legends, they
abounded everywhere. The scattered leaves were
then brought together in the volume called <i>Tales
of the Alhambra</i>.</p>

<p>It is a Spanish arabesque. No book displays
to better advantage the wayward charm of Irving’s
literary genius. Whether recounting old stories
of buried Moorish gold and Arabian necromancy,
or describing the loves of Manuel and bright-eyed
Dolores, or extolling the grace and intelligence of
Carmen, he is equally happy. There was a needy
and shiftless denizen of the place, one Mateo
Ximenes, who captured Irving’s heart by describing
himself as ‘a son of the Alhambra.’ A ribbon-weaver
by trade and an idler by choice, he
attached himself to the newcomer and refused to
be shaken off. If it was impossible to be rid of
him, it was equally impossible not to like him.
Life was a prolonged holiday for Mateo during
Geoffrey Crayon’s residence. Whatever obligations
he had, of a domestic or a business nature,
were joyfully set aside that he might wait upon
the visitor. He became Irving’s ‘prime-minister
and historiographer-royal,’ doing his errands,
aiding in his explorations, and between times unfolding
his accumulated treasures of legend and
tradition. He was flattered by the credence given
his stories, and when the reign of el rey Chico the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
second came to an end, no one lamented more
than Mateo, left now ‘to his old brown cloak, and
his starveling mystery of ribbon-weaving.’</p>

<p>Though not published until after Irving’s return
to America, <i>The Legends of the Conquest of
Spain</i> is a part of the harvest of this same period.
The book describes the decline of the Gothic
power under Witiza and Roderick, the treason of
Count Julian, the coming of the Arabians under
Taric and Muza, and the downfall of Christian
supremacy in the Spanish peninsula. Irving was
a magician in handling words, and this volume is
rich in proof of it. Here may be found passages
of the utmost brilliancy, such as the description of
Roderick’s assault upon the necromantic tower of
Hercules, and the opening of the golden casket.</p>

<p>The <i>Legends</i> serves a double purpose. As a
book of entertainment pure and simple it is unsurpassed.
It is also a spur to the reader to make
his way into wider fields, and to learn yet more of
that people whose history could give rise to these
beautiful illustrations of chivalry and courage.</p>

<h3 id="sec_7">VII<br />

<span class="subhead">AMERICAN HISTORY AND TRAVEL</span>

<span class="subhead"><i>A TOUR ON THE PRAIRIES</i>, <i>ASTORIA</i>, <i>LIFE OF
WASHINGTON</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> list of Irving’s writings between 1835 and
1855 comprises eight titles. Two of these books
have been commented on. The others may be
despatched in a paragraph, as the old reviewers
used to say.</p>

<p><i>Abbotsford and Newstead Abbey</i> is an aftermath
of the English harvest of impressions and experiences.
The <i>Life of Goldsmith</i>, based originally on
Prior’s useful but heavy work, and rewritten when
Forster’s book appeared, is accounted one of the
most graceful of literary biographies. <i>Wolfert’s
Roost</i> is a medley of delightful papers on birds,
Indians, old Dutch villages, and modern American
adventurers, together with a handful of Spanish
stories and legends.</p>

<p>There is a group of three books dealing with
American frontier life and western exploration.
The first of these, <i>A Tour on the Prairies</i>, shows
how readily the trained man of letters can turn
his hand to any subject. Who would have thought
that the prose poet of the Alhambra was also able
to do justice to the trapper and the Pawnee?
<i>Astoria</i> (the first draft of which was made by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
Pierre M. Irving) is an account of John Jacob
Astor’s commercial enterprise in the Northwest.
Irving was amused when an English review pronounced
the book his masterpiece. He had really
taken a deeper interest in the work than he supposed
possible when Astor urged it upon him.
<i>Bonneville</i> in a manner supplements <i>Astoria</i>, and
was written from notes and journals furnished by
the hardy explorer whose name the book bears.</p>

<p>It was fitting that Irving should crown the literary
labors of forty years with a life of Washington.
He had a deep veneration for the memory
of the great American. The theme was peculiarly
grateful to him. He seems to have regarded the
work as something more than a self-imposed and
pleasant literary task—it was a duty to which he
was in the highest degree committed, a duty at
once pious and patriotic. Though he had begun
early to ponder his subject, Irving was nearly seventy
when he commenced the actual writing; and
notwithstanding the book far outgrew the original
plan, he was able to bring it to a successful
conclusion.</p>

<p>Three quarters of the first volume are devoted
to Washington’s history up to his thirty-second
year. It is a graphic account of the young student,
the surveyor, the envoy to the Indians, the captain
of militia. Irving shows how it is possible to
present the ‘real’ Washington without recourse
to exaggerated realism. The remainder of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
volume is given to an outline of the causes leading
to the Revolution, to the affair of Lexington
and Concord, the Battle of Bunker Hill, Washington’s
election to the post of commander-in-chief,
and the beginning of military operations
around Boston. The next three volumes are a
history of the Revolutionary War, with Washington
always the central figure. The fifth volume
covers Washington’s political life, and his last years
at Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>Of two notable characteristics of this book, the
first is its extraordinary readableness. To be sure
the Revolution was a great event, and Irving was
a gifted writer. Nevertheless for a historian who
delights in movement, color, variety, the Revolutionary
War must often seem no better than a
desert of tedious fact relieved now and then by an
oasis of brilliant exploit. Irving complained of
the dulness of many parts of the theme. Notwithstanding
this he brought to the work so much
of his peculiar winsomeness that the <i>Washington</i>
is a book always to be taken up with pleasure and
laid down with regret.</p>

<p>The second notable characteristic is the freedom
from extravagance either of praise or of blame.
The crime and the disgrace of Arnold do not color
adversely the historian’s view of what Arnold was
and did in 1776. No indignant partisan has told
with greater pathos the story of André. Nothing
could be more temperate than Irving’s attitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
towards the Tories, or, as it is now fashionable to
call them, the Loyalists of the American Revolution.
He could not deny sympathy to these unfortunates
who found themselves caught between
the upper and lower millstones, a people who in
many cases were unable to go over heart and soul
to the cause of the King, and who found it even
more difficult to espouse the cause of their own
countrymen. Even the enemies of Washington,
that is to say, the enemies of his own political and
military household, are treated with utmost fairness.</p>

<p>For Washington himself, Irving has only admiration,
which, however, he is able to express without
fulsome panegyric. He dwells on the great
leader’s magnanimity, on his evenness of temper,
his infinite patience, his freedom from trace of
vanity, self-interest, or sectional prejudice, his confidence
in the justness of the cause, and his trust
in Providence, a trust which faltered least when
circumstances were most adverse. Irving admired
unstintedly the warrior who could hold in check
trained and seasoned European soldiers with ‘an
apparently undisciplined rabble,’ the ‘American
Fabius’ who, when the time was ripe, was found
to possess ‘enterprise as well as circumspection,
energy as well as endurance.’</p>

<p>The personal side of the biography is not neglected,
but no emphasis is laid on particulars of
costume, manners, speech, what Washington ate
and drank, and said about his neighbors. Irving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
could have had little sympathy with the modern
rage for knowing the size of a great man’s collar
and the number of his footgear. The passion for
such details is legitimate, but it is a passion which
needs to be firmly controlled. In brief, throughout
the work emphasis is laid where emphasis
belongs, on the character of Washington, who was
the soul of the Revolutionary War, and then on
the moral grandeur of that great struggle for
human rights.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>A historian of American literature says: ‘Irving
had no message.’ He was not indeed enslaved
by a theory literary or political; neither
was he passionate for some reform and convinced
that his particular reform was paramount. But he
who gave to the world a series of writings which,
in addition to being exquisite examples of literary
art, are instinct with humor, brotherly kindness,
and patriotism, can hardly be said not to have had
a message.</p>

<p>Irving rendered an immense service to the biographical
study of history. Columbus, Mahomet,
the princes and warriors of the Holy War, are
made real to us. Nor is this all. His books help
to counteract that tendency of the times to make
history a recondite science. History cannot be
confined to the historians and erudite readers
alone. Said Freeman to his Oxford audience one
day: ‘Has anybody read the essay on Race and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Language in the third series of my Historical Essays?
It is very stiff reading, so perhaps nobody
has.’ And one suspects that Freeman rejoiced a
little to think it was ‘stiff reading.’</p>

<p>Nevertheless the public insists on its right to
know the main facts. And as Leslie Stephen says,
‘the main facts are pretty well ascertained. Darnley
was blown up, whoever supplied the powder,
and the Spanish Armada certainly came somehow
to grief.’ That man of letters is a benefactor
who, like Irving, can give his audience the main
facts, expressed in terms which make history more
readable even than romance.</p>

<p>Irving perfected the short story. His genius
was fecundative. Many a writer of gift and taste,
and at least one writer of genius, owes Irving a
debt which can be acknowledged but which cannot
be paid. Deriving much from his literary predecessors,
and gladly acknowledging the measure
of his obligation, Irving by the originality of his
work placed fresh obligations on those who came
after him.</p>

<p>With his stories of Dutch life he conquered a
new domain. That these stories remain in their
first and untarnished beauty is due to Irving’s
rich humor and ‘golden style,’ and to that indescribable
quality of genius by which it lifts its
creations out of the local and provincial, and endows
them with a charm which all can understand
and enjoy.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> author of ‘Thanatopsis’ was born at Cummington,
a village among the hills of western
Massachusetts, on November 3, 1794. Through
his father, Doctor Peter Bryant, a physician, he
traced his ancestry to Stephen Bryant, an early settler
at Duxbury; through his mother, Sarah Snell,
he had ‘a triple claim’ to ‘Mayflower’ origin.</p>

<p>Doctor Bryant was a many-sided man. He collected
books, read poetry (Horace was his favorite),
wrote satirical verse, was a musician and something
of a mechanic. He was an ardent Federalist, a
member of the Massachusetts legislature for several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
terms, and then of the senate. He possessed
in high degree the art of imparting knowledge.
Medical students thought themselves fortunate in
being allowed to study under his direction. Doctor
Bryant’s father and grandfather were both physicians,
and he hoped that his second-born (who
was named in honor of the Scottish practitioner,
William Cullen) would follow in the ancestral footsteps.</p>

<p>Bryant began to make verses in his eighth year.
At ten he wrote an ‘address’ in heroic couplets,
which got into newspaper print. The boy used to
pray that he might write verses which would endure.
A political satire, <i>The Embargo or Sketches
of the Times</i>, ‘by a youth of thirteen,’ if not in
the nature of evidence that the prayer had been
answered, so delighted Doctor Bryant that he
printed it in a pamphlet (1808). A second issue
containing additional poems was brought out the
next year. To this the author put his name.</p>

<p>Bryant was taught Greek by his uncle, the Reverend
Thomas Snell of Brookfield, and mathematics
by the Reverend Moses Hallock of Plainfield. He
entered the Sophomore class at Williams College
in October, 1810, and left the following May. He
was to have spent the two succeeding years at
Yale, but the plan had to be abandoned for want
of money. Some time during the summer of 1811
‘Thanatopsis’ was written in its first form and
laid aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>The poet began reading law with Judge Samuel
Howe of Worthington, who once reproached his
pupil ‘for giving to Wordsworth’s <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>
time that belonged to Blackstone and Chitty.’
He continued his studies under William Baylies of
Bridgewater, was admitted to the bar at Plymouth
in August, 1815, practised awhile at Plainfield,
and then removed to Great Barrington. The lines
‘To a Waterfowl’ were written the night of the
young lawyer’s arrival in Plainfield.</p>

<p>He made progress in his profession and was
called to argue cases at New Haven and before
the supreme court at Boston. The intervals of
legal business were given to poetry. Bryant’s
father urged him to contribute to the new ‘North
American Review and Miscellaneous Journal,’ the
editor of which was an old friend. The young
lawyer-poet seeming indifferent to the suggestion,
Doctor Bryant carried with him to Boston two
pieces he had unearthed among his son’s papers,
namely, ‘Thanatopsis’ in its first form, and ‘A
Fragment’ now called ‘Inscription at the Entrance
of a Wood.’ Both were printed in the
‘Review’ for September, 1817. Other poems
followed, together with three prose essays (on
‘American Poetry,’ on ‘The Happy Temperament,’
and on the use of ‘Trisyllabic Feet in Iambic
Verse’). He also contributed poems to ‘The
Idle Man,’ Richard Henry Dana’s magazine, and
the ‘United States Literary Gazette.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>In June, 1821, Bryant married Miss Frances
Fairchild of Great Barrington. In April of this
year he had been invited to give ‘the usual poetic
address’ before the Phi Beta Kappa Society at
Harvard. ‘The Ages’ was written for this occasion
and publicly read on August 30. At the instance
of his Boston friends, Bryant printed ‘The
Ages’ with seven other pieces in a little pamphlet
entitled <i>Poems</i>.</p>

<p>Never in love with the law, the poet began to regard
it with aversion. He was intellectually restless
and took to play-writing. A farce, ‘The Heroes,’
in ridicule of duelling, was sent to his friends, the
Sedgwicks, in New York, who admitted its merits
but doubted its chances of success on the stage,
Bryant, at the suggestion of Henry Sedgwick,
made two or three visits to the city in search
of congenial work. He thought he had found it
when he undertook to edit ‘The New York Review
and Athenæum Magazine,’ a periodical made
by amalgamating ‘The Atlantic Magazine’ with
the older ‘Literary Review.’ Bryant wrote to a
friend that it was a livelihood, ‘and a livelihood is
all I got from the law.’</p>

<p>The editor of the ‘Review’ was active in various
ways. He studied the Romance languages,
gave a course of lectures on poetry before the
Athenæum Society (1825), and annual courses on
mythology before the National Academy of the
Arts of Design (1826–31). He was amused with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
New York life; Great Barrington had not been
amusing. He published verse and prose in his
own review and helped Sands and Verplanck edit
their annual, ‘The Talisman.’ Somewhat later he
edited <i>Tales of the Glauber Spa</i> (1832), the joint
work of Sands, Leggett, Paulding, Miss Sedgwick,
and himself.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>The ‘Review’ suffered from changes in the
business management, and Bryant’s prospects became
gloomy. At this juncture (1826) he was
invited to act as assistant to William Coleman,
editor of the ‘New York Evening Post.’ In
1828 he became ‘a small proprietor in the establishment,’
and when Coleman died (July, 1829)
Bryant assumed the post of editor-in-chief and
engaged as his assistant William Leggett, a young
New Yorker who had shown a marked ability in
conducting a weekly journal called ‘The Critic.’
‘I like politics no better than you do’ (Bryant had
written to Dana), ‘but ... politics and a bellyfull
are better than poetry and starvation.’</p>

<p>His theory of the journalist’s function is well
known. ‘He regarded himself as a trustee for the
public.’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Party was much, and Bryant was a strong
Democrat, but the people were greater than party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>Bryant’s handling of public questions belongs to
political history. His lifelong fight against a protective
tariff, his defence of Jackson’s policy respecting
nullification and the United States Bank,
his maintenance of the right to discuss slavery as
freely as any other subject about which there is a difference
of opinion, his insistence that the question
of giving the franchise to negroes in the state of
New York be settled on its merits and as a local
matter with which neither Abolitionist nor slave-holder
had anything to do, his determined stand
against the annexation of Texas and enlargement
of the area of slavery, his position on a multitude
of questions which in his life as a public censor he
found it necessary to defend or to attack—are
fully set forth in the two biographies by his coadjutors.</p>

<p>From 1856 Bryant acted with the Republican
party, giving his cordial support to Frémont and
to Lincoln. He was a presidential elector in 1861.
He advocated the election of Grant in 1868, and
again in 1872, the latter time reluctantly ‘as the
best thing attainable in the circumstances.’</p>

<p>To secure the independence and detachment
that would enable him to judge measures fairly,
Bryant avoided intercourse with public men, kept
away from Washington, took no office, and was
otherwise singular. In this way he at least secured
a free pen. As to the tone of the comments on
men in public life, Bryant approved the theory of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
a brother editor who maintained that nothing
should be said which would make it impossible
for him who wrote and him who was written about
to meet at the same dinner-table the next day. It
is not pretended, however, that he was uniformly
controlled by this theory. What was the prevailing
idea of his journalistic manner may be known
from Felton’s review of <i>The Fountain</i>, in which he
marvels that these beautiful poems can be the work
of one ‘who deals with wrath, and dips his pen
daily in bitterness and hate....’</p>

<p>Since 1821 no collection of Bryant’s verse had
been made. Then after ten years he gathered together
eighty-nine pieces, including the eight which
had appeared in the pamphlet of 1821, and issued
them as <i>Poems</i>, 1832. Through the friendly offices
of Irving the book was reprinted in England with
a dedicatory letter to Samuel Rogers. Notwithstanding
favorable notices, both English and American,
Bryant was despondent. ‘Poetic wares,’ he
said, ‘are not for the market of the present day
... mankind are occupied with politics, railroads,
and steamboats.’ But he found it necessary to reprint
the volume in 1834 (with additional poems),
and again in 1836.</p>

<p>His work in prose and verse after 1839 includes
<i>The Fountain and Other Poems</i>, 1842; <i>The White-Footed
Deer and Other Poems</i>, 1844; <i>Poems</i>, 1847;
<i>Letters of a Traveller</i>, 1850; <i>Poems</i>, 1854; <i>Letters
from Spain</i>, 1859; <i>Thirty Poems</i>, 1864; <i>Letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
from the East</i>, 1869; <i>The Iliad of Homer, translated
into English blank verse</i>, 1870; <i>The Odyssey</i>,
1871–72; <i>Orations and Addresses</i>, 1873; <i>The Flood
of Tears</i>, 1878.</p>

<p>The introduction to the <i>Library of Poetry and
Song</i> is from Bryant’s pen, as is also the preface
to E. A. Duyckinck’s (still unpublished) edition
of Shakespeare. His name appears as one of
the authors of <i>A Popular History of the United
States</i> (1876), together with that of Sydney Howard
Gay, on whom fell the burden of the actual
writing. It is unfortunate that no adequate reprint
of Bryant’s political leaders has been made. As
much ought to be done for him as Sedgwick did
for Leggett.</p>

<p>Bryant found relief from the strain of editorial
work in foreign travel. He was abroad with his
family in 1834–36, visiting France, Italy, and Germany.
He did his sight-seeing deliberately, spending
a month in Rome, two months at Florence,
three months in Munich, and so on. He had been
four months at Heidelberg, when, says one of his
biographers (in phrases which he never learned
from Bryant), ‘His studious sojourn at this renowned
seat of learning was interrupted by intelligence
of the dangerous illness of his editorial
colleague,’ and he returned home. During a visit
to England in 1845 Bryant met Rogers, Moore,
Herschel, Hallam, and Spedding, heard one of his
own poems quoted at a Corn Law meeting, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
among the speakers were Cobden and Bright, and
carried a letter of introduction to Wordsworth
from Henry Crabb Robinson. He made yet other
journeys to Europe and to the East.</p>

<p>Notable among Bryant’s public addresses were
the orations on Cooper (1852) and Irving (1860)
delivered before the New York Historical Society.
He was a founder and the third president of the
Century Association, first president of the New
York Homœopathic Society, president of the
American Free Trade League, and member of
literary and historical societies innumerable. He
held no public office, but as time went on it might
almost be said that an office was created for him—that
of Representative American. He seemed the
incarnation of virtues popularly supposed to have
survived from an older and simpler time. He was
a great public character. The word venerable acquired
a new meaning as one reflected on the career
of this eminent citizen who was born when Washington
was president, who as a boy had written
satires on Jefferson, and who as a man had discussed
political questions from the administration
of John Quincy Adams to that of Hayes. Other
men were as old as he, Bryant seemed to have lived
longer.</p>

<p>‘And when at last he fell, he fell as the granite
column falls, smitten from without, but sound
within.’<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> His death was the result of an accident.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
He gave the address at the unveiling of the statue
of Mazzini in Central Park. Though wearied with
the exertion and almost overcome by the heat, he
was able to walk to the house of a friend. As he
was about entering the door he fell backward,
striking his head violently against the stone step.
He never recovered from the effects of this fall,
and died on June 12, 1878.</p>

<h3 id="sec_9">II<br />

<span class="subhead">BRYANT’S CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">We</span> seldom think of Bryant other than as he
appears in the Sarony photograph of 1873. With
the snowy beard, the furrowed brow, the sunken
but keen eyes, a cloak thrown about the shoulders,
he is the ideal poet of popular imagination. Thus
must he have looked when he wrote ‘The Flood
of Years,’ and it is difficult to realize that he did
not look thus when he wrote ‘Thanatopsis.’ We
do not readily picture Bryant as young or even
middle-aged.</p>

<p>Parke Godwin saw him first about 1837. He
had a ‘wearied, almost saturnine expression of
countenance.’ He was spare in figure, of medium
height, clean shaven, and had an ‘unusually large
head.’ He spoke with decision, but could not be
called a copious talker. His voice was noticeably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
sweet, his choice of words and accuracy of pronunciation
remarkable. When anything was said
to awaken mirth, his eyes gleamed with ‘a singular
radiance and a short, quick, staccato but hearty
laugh followed.’ He was more sociable when
his wife and daughters were present than at other
times. Bryant’s reserve was always a conspicuous
trait.</p>

<p>Under that prim exterior lurked fire and passion.
‘In court he often lost his self-control.’ It
was thought that Bryant might keep a promise he
once made of thrashing a legal opponent within
an inch of his life (‘if he ever says that again’)
though the man was twice his size. Not long
after he became editor-in-chief of the ‘Post’ Bryant
cowhided a journalistic adversary who had bestowed
upon him by name, ‘the most insulting
epithet that can be applied to a human being.’<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
It was the only time his well-schooled temper outwitted
him.</p>

<p>His friendships were strong and abiding. He
had an inflexible will and a keen sense of justice,
so keen that it drove him out of the law. No
thought of personal ease or advantage could turn
him from a course he had mapped out as right.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
He was generous. His benefactions were many
and judicious, and the manner of their bestowal
as unpretending as possible.</p>

<p>Bryant’s ‘unassailable dignity’ was a marked trait
of character. He refused an invitation to a dinner
given Charles Dickens by a ‘prominent citizen’
of New York. ‘That man,’ said Bryant, ‘has
known me for years without asking me to his
house, and I am not going to be made a stool-pigeon
to attract birds of passage that may be
flying about.’</p>

<p>He was perfectly simple-minded, incapable of
assuming the air of famous poet or successful man
of the world. Doubtless he relished praise, but he
had an adroit way of putting compliments to one
side, tempering the gratitude he really felt with an
ironical humor.</p>

<h3 id="sec_10">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE LITERARY CRAFTSMAN</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Bryant</span> was a deliberate and fastidious writer.
His literary executors could never have said of
him that they found ‘neither blot nor erasure
among his papers.’ His copy, written on the
backs of old letters or rejected manuscripts, was a
wilderness of interlineations and corrections, and
often hard to decipher.</p>

<p>Famous as he was for correctness, it seems a mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
debauch of eulogy to affirm that all of Bryant’s
contributions to the ‘Evening Post’ do not contain
‘as many erroneous or defective forms of expression’
as ‘can be found in the first ten numbers of
the <i>Spectator</i>.’ But there is little danger of overestimating
his influence on the English of journalism
during the forty years and more that he set the
example of a high standard of daily writing. He
was sparing of advice, though in earlier days he
could not always conquer the temptation to amuse
himself over the English of his brother editors.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> It
has been denied that he had any part in compiling
the famous ‘index expurgatorius,’ but it is not
unreasonable to suppose that this list, embodying
traditions of the editorial office, had his approval.
Bryant was for directness and precision in
writing. Ideas must stand on their merits, if they
have them, for such phrasing will define them
perfectly.</p>

<p>His prose style may be studied in his books of
travel and his addresses. The literary characteristic
of <i>Letters of a Traveller</i> and its companion volumes
is excessive plainness, a homely quality like that
of a village pedagogue careful not to make mistakes.
One is often reminded of the honest home-spun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
prose of Henry Wansey’s <i>Excursion to the
United States</i>.</p>

<p>Turning to the volume of <i>Orations and Addresses</i>,
the reader finds himself in another world. Bryant’s
memorial orations are among the best of their kind,
stately, uplifting, and at times even majestic. They
belong to a type of composition which lies midway
between oratory and literature and unites certain
characteristics of each. Written primarily to be
heard, and adapted to public utterance, they are
also meant to be read. They must stand the test
of the ear and then that of the eye. The listener
must find his account in them as they come from
the lips of the orator, and he who afterward turns at
leisure the pages of the printed report must be satisfied.
Bryant’s speeches are markedly ‘literary;’
and though oratorical they are wholly free from
bombast. Poet though he was, he built no cloud-capped
towers of rhetoric.</p>

<p>Coming now to his verse, we find that his poetic
flights, though lofty, were neither frequent nor long
continued. Apparently he was incapable of writing
much or often. This seems true even after allowance
is made for his busy and exacting life as a
journalist. For years together he composed but a
few lines in each year.</p>

<p>His theory fitted his own limitations. Bryant
maintained that there is no such thing as a long
poem, that what are commonly called long poems
are in reality a succession of short poems united<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
by poetical links. The paradox grows out of the
vagueness attaching to the words ‘length’ and
‘poem.’ Exactly what a poem is, we shall never
know. That is a shadowy line which divides poetry
from verse. And there is no term so unmeaning
as length. When does a poem begin to be long—is
it when the poet has achieved a hundred verses
or a thousand, when he has written six cantos or
twelve?</p>

<p>To say, as Bryant is reported to have said, that
‘a long poem is no more conceivable than a long
ecstasy,’ is to make all poetry dependent on an
ecstatic condition. And it reduces all poetic temperaments
to the same level. Why may not poetry
be an outcome of ‘the true enthusiasm that burns
long’?</p>

<p>Bryant showed skill in handling a variety of
metrical forms; it is unsafe to say that he excelled
only in blank verse. With declared partisanship
for the short poem, he nevertheless did not cultivate
the sonnet. Up to the time he was fifty-eight years
of age he had written but twelve, and for some of
these he apologized, saying, ‘they are rather poems
in fourteen lines than sonnets.’</p>

<p>Comparing the length of his life with the slenderness
of his poetical product, we are tempted to
bring against this eminent man the charge of wilful
unproductiveness. This reluctance, or inertia,
or whatever it may be called, has helped to give
the impression of a lack of spontaneity. We are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
aware of the effort through the very exactness
with which the thing has been done. Bryant resembled
certain pianists who plead as excuse for
not playing, a lack of recent practice. When after
repeated urgings one of the reluctant brotherhood
‘consents to favor us,’ he plays with precision
enough but rarely with abandon. The conscious
and over-solicitous artist shows in every note.</p>

<p>If much writing has its drawbacks, it also has its
value. And the poet who sings frequently cannot
offer as a reason for not performing, the excuse that
his lyre has not been out of the case for weeks, and
that in all probability a string is broken.</p>

<h3 id="sec_11">IV<br />

<span class="subhead">THE POET</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> fine stanzas entitled ‘The Poet’ contain
Bryant’s theory of his art. The framing of a
deathless poem is not the pastime of a drowsy
summer’s day.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">No smooth array of phrase,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Artfully sought and ordered though it be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which the cold rhymer lays</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Upon his page with languid industry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can wake the listless pulse to livelier speed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or fill with sudden tears the eyes that read.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The secret wouldst thou know</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To touch the heart or fire the blood at will?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let thine own eyes o’erflow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Let thy lips quiver with the passionate thrill;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seize the great thought, ere yet its power be past,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bind, in words, the fleet emotion fast.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet let no empty gust</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of passion find an utterance in thy lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A blast that whirls the dust</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Along the howling street and dies away;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But feelings of calm power and mighty sweep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like currents journeying through the windless deep.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is flat contradiction of the idea that entirely
self-conscious and self-controlled art can
avail to move the reader. Bryant pleads for deepest
feeling in exercise of the poetic function; it is
more than important, it is indispensable. Of that
striking poem ‘The Tides,’ he said ‘it was written
with a certain awe upon me which made me
hope that there might be something in it.’ The
poem proved to be one of Bryant’s noblest conceptions.
Yet a lady of ‘judgment’ told one of
Bryant’s friends, who of course told him, that she
did not think there was much in it.</p>

<p>Nature appeals to Bryant in her broad and
massive aspects. ‘The Prairies’ is an illustration.
Gazing on the ‘encircling vastness’ for the first
time, the heart swells and the eye dilates in an
effort to comprehend <span class="locked">it:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">Lo! they stretch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In airy undulations, far away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if the ocean, in his gentlest swell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stood still, with all his rounded billows fixed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And motionless forever.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the poet looks abroad over the vast and
glowing fields, there sweeps by him a vision of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
races that have peopled these solitudes and perished
to make room for races to come. It is magnificent
even if it is not scientific. In the sense it
gives of the spaciousness of the prairies with the
myriad sounds of life projected on the great elemental
silence, it is a true American poem.</p>

<p>‘A Hymn of the Sea’ is another illustration of
that largeness of view characteristic of Bryant.
Each thought is lofty and far-reaching. The cloud
that rises from the ‘realm of rain’ shadows whole
countries, the tornado wrecks a fleet, whirling the
vast hulks ‘like chaff upon the <span class="locked">waves:’—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">These restless surges eat away the shores</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of earth’s old continents; the fertile plain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Welters in shallows, headlands crumble down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the tide drifts the sea-sand in the streets</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the drowned city.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He conveys the idea not only of spaciousness
but of endless duration in the lines describing the
coral worm laying his ‘mighty reefs,’ toiling from
‘age to age’ until</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">His bulwarks overtop the brine, and check</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The long wave rolling from the southern pole</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To break upon Japan.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Certain lines in ‘A Forest Hymn’ are also remarkable
for the sense they give of vast reaches
of time, stretching not forward but backward into
<span class="locked">eternity:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">These lofty trees</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wave not less proudly that their ancestors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moulder beneath them. Oh, there is not lost</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">One of earth’s charms: upon her bosom yet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">After the flight of untold centuries,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The freshness of her far beginning lies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And yet shall lie.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The ‘Song of the Stars,’ though not one of
Bryant’s happiest poems,—the hypercritical reader
feeling that the ‘orbs of beauty’ and ‘spheres of
flame’ might have made a more appropriate metrical
choice for their song,—shows none the less
the poet’s strength in dealing with nature in the
large. The lines ‘To a Waterfowl’ are magical
in part by virtue of the impression they make of
immense distance. With the poet’s penetrating
vision we can see the solitary way through the
rosy depths, the pathless coast, and the one bit
of life in</p>

<p class="center">
The desert and illimitable air.<br />
</p>

<p>Bryant’s mind readily lifts itself from the minute
to the massive, as in the poem ‘Summer Wind,’
a fine example of the crescendo effects he knew
so well how to produce. In a few lines he gives
the sensation of heat, closeness, exhaustion, and
pictures the plants drooping in a stillness broken
only by the ‘faint and interrupted murmur of the
bee.’ His thought then sweeps upward to the
wooded hills towering in scorching heat and dazzling
light, and then still higher to the bright
clouds,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Motionless pillars of the brazen heaven—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their bases on the mountains—their white tops</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shining in the far ether....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>
<p>The poet never wearies of this majestic pageantry
of the natural world. In ‘The Firmament,’
in ‘The Hurricane’ (imitated from Heredia),
in ‘Monument Mountain,’ his chief thought is to
translate the reader to his own lofty vantage-ground.</p>

<p>But Nature is not merely a spectacle, it has a
power to heal and invigorate. Life loses its pettiness
when one leaves the city and seeks the forest.
The holy men who hid themselves ‘deep in
the woody wilderness’ perhaps did not <span class="locked">well—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But let me often to these solitudes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Retire, and in thy presence reassure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My feeble virtue. Here its enemies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The passions, at thy plainer footsteps shrink</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tremble and are still.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The poet finds inspiration not alone in the terror
of the storm, the majesty of the forest, the gray
waste of ocean, the mystery of the night of stars,
but in the humbler things, the rivulet by which
he played as a child, the violet growing on its
bank, the hum of bees, the notes of hang-bird and
wren, the gossip of swallows, and the gay chirp
of the ground squirrel. ‘The Yellow Violet’
and the lines ‘To the Fringed Gentian’ spring
from this love of the unobtrusive charms of Nature.
Less familiar than these, but a faultless example
of Bryant’s art, is ‘The Painted <span class="locked">Cup:’—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent26">... tell me not</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>
<p>The poet will not call up ‘faded fancies of an
‘elder world.’ If the fresh savannahs must be
peopled with creatures of imagination, it may be
done without borrowing European <span class="locked">elves:—</span></p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Slender and small, his rounded cheek all brown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ruddy with the sunshine; let him come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On summer mornings, when the blossoms wake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And part with little hands the spiky grass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And touching, with his cherry lips, the edge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of these bright beakers, drain the gathered dew.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bryant wrote poems of freedom. The earlier
of these, ‘The Song of the Greek Amazon,’ the
‘Massacre at Scio,’ the ‘Greek Partisan,’ and
‘Italy,’ voice his sympathy with the oppressed nations
of the Old World, the ‘struggling multitude
of states,’ that ‘writhe in shackles.’</p>

<p>Among his later poems on the same theme,
‘Earth,’ ‘The Winds,’ ‘The Antiquity of Freedom,’
and ‘The Battle Field’ are representative.
The first three with their many stately lines show
how spontaneously his thought, even when nature
is not the subject, grows out of the contemplation
of nature and then returns to such contemplation
as to a resting place. ‘The Battle Field,’
the expression of a noble faith in the outcome of
‘a friendless warfare,’ contains the most inspiring
of his quatrains, as it is one of the best contributions
made by an American poet to the stock of
quotable English <span class="locked">verse:—</span></p>

    <div class="verse indent2">And dies among his worshippers.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His patriotic poems are few in number, but
Bryant’s reticence must be taken into account.
Coming from him, the verses mean more than if
they came from another. Two of the best are ‘Oh
Mother of a mighty Race’ and ‘Not Yet.’ The
second of these, written in July, 1861, has a finely
imaginative stanza in which are pictured the dead
monarchies of the past eager to welcome another
broken and ruined land among their <span class="locked">number:—</span></p>

<p>Such was the temper of men who had looked
with philosophic composure and curiosity on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
movements of the sometimes well-nigh frenzied
abolitionists. The blow at the integrity of the
nation fired their cool patriotism to white heat.</p>

<p>What lightness of touch Bryant had is shown
in that exquisite lyric ‘The Stream of Life.’ He
could be conventional, as in the love poem where
he celebrates ‘the gentle season’ when ‘nymphs
relent,’ and very sensibly advises the young lady
’ere her bloom is past, to secure her lover.’ He
was not strong in wit or humor. The verses ‘To
a Mosquito’ might have been read with good
effect to a party of well-fed clubmen after dinner,
but finding them in the same volume with ‘A
Forest Hymn’ gives one an uncomfortable surprise,
like finding a pun in Lowell’s <i>Cathedral</i>.
That Bryant could write agreeable narrative verse,
‘The Children of the Snow’ and ‘Sella’ bear witness.
That he is at his best in meditative poems,
lofty characterizations of Nature, grand visions of
Life and Death, is proved by hundreds of felicitous
verses which have become an inalienable part of
our young literature.</p>

<p>He never really excelled the work of his youth.
Bryant will always be known as the author of
‘Thanatopsis.’ This great vision of Death is his
stateliest poem and his best, the most felicitous
of phrase and the loftiest in imagery. Written by
a stoic, magnificently stoical in tone, it offers but
a stoic’s comfort after all. Perhaps this is a secret
of its popularity, on the theory that while professed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
pagans are few the instinct towards paganism
still exists, and most among those who say
least about it.</p>

<h3 id="sec_12">V<br />

<span class="subhead">LATEST POETICAL WORK</span>

<span class="subhead"><i>THE ILIAD</i> AND <i>THE ODYSSEY</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> collected edition of Bryant’s poems of 1854
contains a handful of translations, twelve from the
Spanish, four from the German, one each from
the French, the Provençal, the Portuguese, and
the Greek. In 1864 a translation of the fifth book
of the <i>Odyssey</i> was printed in the volume entitled
<i>Thirty Poems</i>. The praise which it called out gave
Bryant the impulse to further experiments of the
same sort; and after the death of his wife (in 1866),
when the necessity was upon him of forgetting his
grief so far as possible in some engrossing work, he
undertook a version of the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>
entire.</p>

<p>He gave himself methodically to the task,
translating about forty lines a day. Later he increased
the daily stint to seventy-five lines. He
chose blank verse because ‘the use of rhyme in a
translation is a constant temptation to petty infidelities.’</p>

<p>Bryant retained the misleading Latin forms of
proper names. Worsley says: ‘Not even Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
Gladstone’s example can now make Juno, Mercury,
and Venus admissible in Homeric story.’
But Worsley confessed his own inability to write
Phoibos, Apollôn, and Kirké. Bryant’s argument
for his course looks specious: ‘I was translating
from Greek into English, and I therefore translated
the names of the gods, as well as the other
parts of the poem.’ Probably he had an affection
for the old nomenclature, a sentiment like
Macaulay’s, who ‘never could reconcile himself
to seeing the friends of his boyhood figure as
Kleon, and Alkibiadês, and Poseidôn, and Odysseus.’<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>An enthusiastic admirer of Bryant declares that
in the opinion of ‘competent critics’ his versions
of Homer ‘will hold their own with the translations
of Pope, Chapman, Newman, or the late
Earl Derby.’ Much depends on the question of
what a ‘competent critic’ is, and which one of several
competent critics is to be taken as final authority.
Competent critics, who, by the way, seldom
agree, have a habit of agreeing on anything sooner
than the merits of a version of Homer. And when
one remembers the fearful attack made by Matthew
Arnold on Newman (‘Any vivacities of expression
which may have given him pain I sincerely regret’)—he
may well hesitate to take as a compliment
the statement that Bryant will ‘hold his
own’ with Newman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>The question of the higher merit of the poem
rests with the experts at last. Pessimists all, they
are discouragingly hostile to metrical versions of
the <i>Iliad</i>. Yet the most uncompromising of them
would hardly deny a lay reader the privilege of
enjoying Homer, in so far as possible, through the
medium of Bryant’s blank verse. They might even
be persuaded to admit that this version has a peculiar
adaptability to the needs of the public; that the
clarity and beauty of the English, the dignified ease
of the measure, the sustained energy and vigor of
the performance as a whole, fit Bryant’s Homer in
a high degree to the use for which it was intended.
The argument from popularity, that always unsafe
and often vicious argument, has a measure of force
here. Granting that Homer in any honest translation
is better than no Homer at all, may not the
uncompromising scholars be called on to rejoice
that this more than honest, nay, this admirable
translation of the <i>Iliad</i> has sold to the extent of
many thousands of copies? Where there are so
many buyers, there must be readers not a few.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Bryant was one of those unusual men who have
two distinct callings. Much surprise has been expressed
at his apparent ability to carry on his functions
of journalist and poet without clash. But is
it true, or more than superficially true, that he did
so carry them on? To be sure, he wrote his editorial
articles at the newspaper office and his verses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
elsewhere, but this is a mere mechanical distinction.
A man of Bryant’s depth of conviction and
passionate temperament does not throw off care
when he boards a suburban train for his country
home.</p>

<p>The history of Bryant’s inner life has not been
written, perhaps cannot be. This is not to imply
that his character was enigmatic and mysterious,
but merely to emphasize the fact of his extraordinary
reserve. More than most self-contained men
he kept his own counsel. Such a history would
show how deep his experience of the world had
ploughed into him, and it might explain in a degree
the remote and stoical character of his verse.</p>

<p>Bryant’s poetical work as a whole has an impassive
quality often described as coldness. Partly
due to his genius and accentuated by the excessive
retouching to which he subjected his verse, it grew
in still larger measure out of his determination not
to impart to his verse any of the feverishness of
spirit consequent upon a life of political warfare.
The poet held himself wonderfully in check, as a
man of iron will allows no mark of the strong passion
under which he labors to show in his face.
Bryant was rarely betrayed into so much of personal
feeling as flashed out in that bitter stanza of
‘The Future <span class="locked">Life:’—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For me the sordid cares in which I dwell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Shrink and consume my heart, as heat the scroll;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wrath has left its scar—that fire of hell</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Has left its scar upon my soul.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>
<p>While the detachment was not complete, Bryant
undoubtedly kept his poetic apart from his secular
life in a way to command admiration. This he
accomplished by extraordinary self-restraint. As a
part of the varied and long-continued discipline
to which he subjected himself, the self-restraint
made for character. The question, however, arises
whether the poetry did not, in certain ways, suffer
under the very discipline by which the character
developed.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">James Cooper</span> was the eleventh of the twelve
children of William and Elizabeth (Fenimore)
Cooper, of Burlington, New Jersey. He was born
in that picturesque town by the Delaware on September
15, 1789. The name James, given him in
honor of his grandfather, had also been borne by
his first American ancestor, who is said to have
come from Stratford-on-Avon, in 1679. In fulfilment
of a promise to his mother (whose family
had become extinct in the male line), the novelist,
in 1826, changed his name to Fenimore-Cooper.</p>

<p>At the close of the Revolutionary War, William
Cooper acquired large tracts of land on Otsego
Lake in New York, settled there in 1790, founded
the village still known as Cooperstown, and built<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
for himself a stately home to which he gave the
name of Otsego Hall. He was the first judge of
the county and a member of Congress, a man
of strong character and agreeable address.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Cooper’s boyhood was passed amid picturesque
natural surroundings, on the edge of civilization,
the scene of <i>The Deerslayer</i> and <i>The Pioneers</i>. He
attended the village school, prepared for college
with the rector of St. Peter’s Church, Albany,
entered Yale in the second term of the Freshman
year (Class of 1806), and was dismissed in the
Junior year for some boyish escapade the nature
of which is unexplained.</p>

<p>It was decided that he should enter the navy.
There was then no training school, and boys took
the first lessons in seamanship in the merchant
marine. Cooper spent a year before the mast in
the ‘Sterling,’ sailing from New York to London,
thence to Gibraltar, back to London, and from
London to Philadelphia. His experiences are set
forth in the early chapters of <i>Ned Myers</i>. The
‘Sterling’ lost two of her best hands by impressment
as soon as she reached English waters.
Cooper’s indignation at these outrages afterwards
found voice through the lips of Ithuel Bolt in the
story entitled <i>Wing-and-Wing</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>He was commissioned midshipman on January
1, 1808, and served awhile on the ‘Vesuvius.’ In
the following winter he was one of the party sent
to Oswego to build a brig for the defence of the
lake, and became acquainted with the regions described
in <i>The Pathfinder</i>. In the summer of 1809
he had charge of the gun-boats on Lake Champlain,
and in the autumn was ordered to the sloop
of war ‘Wasp.’</p>

<p>He left the service on his betrothal with Miss
Susan DeLancey of Mamaroneck, New York,
whom he married on January 1, 1811. For a few
years he lived the life of a landed proprietor, dividing
his time between Cooperstown, Scarsdale, and
Mamaroneck. The dulness of a novel he was reading
aloud to his wife provoked him to say that he
could write a better one himself. Challenged to
prove it, he produced <i>Precaution</i> (1820), a story of
English life, following conventional lines. It was
apprentice work. The effort of composition taught
Cooper that he could write, but not that he could
write well. He had no conceit of the book, and
refused it a place in his collected writings.</p>

<p>In 1821 <i>The Spy, a Tale of the Neutral Ground</i>,
was published; its unqualified good fortune made
Cooper a professed man of letters. From that time
on until his death, twenty-nine years later, he produced
books with uninterrupted regularity.</p>

<p><i>The Spy</i> was followed by <i>The Pioneers, or the
Sources of the Susquehanna</i>, 1823; <i>The Pilot, a Tale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
of the Sea</i>, 1824; <i>Lionel Lincoln, or the Leaguer of
Boston</i>, 1825; <i>The Last of the Mohicans, a Narrative
of 1757</i>, 1826. But one of this group of
four can be pronounced a failure and two have
had a success almost phenomenal in the history of
letters.</p>

<p>Cooper shared the American passion for seeing
foreign lands. The proceeds of authorship enabled
him to carry out a plan he had formed of spending
some time abroad. With his family and servants
(a party of ten in all), he set sail from New
York on June 1, 1826. He proposed to be gone
five years. He overstayed that time by two years
and five months. From May, 1826, to about
January, 1829, he held the ‘nominal position’ of
American consul at Lyons. His journeyings were
made in a leisurely way after the fashion of the
time. Eighteen months were spent in Paris and
the vicinity, four months in London, and a few
weeks in Holland, Belgium, and Switzerland. The
winter of 1828–29 was passed in Florence, and was
followed by a voyage to Naples. After spending
some months at Sorrento and Naples, he settled
in Rome for the winter of 1829–30. Thence to
Venice, Munich, Dresden, and finally back to
Paris.</p>

<p>He published while abroad <i>The Prairie</i>, 1827;
<i>The Red Rover</i>, 1828; <i>Notions of the Americans,
Picked up by a Travelling Bachelor</i>, 1828; <i>The
Wept of Wish-ton-Wish</i>, 1829; <i>The Water-Witch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
or the Skimmer of the Seas</i>, 1830; <i>The Bravo</i>,
1831; <i>The Heidenmauer, or the Benedictines</i>, 1832;
<i>The Headsman, or the Abbaye des Vignerons</i>, 1833.</p>

<p>In November, 1833, Cooper returned to America.
That and several ensuing winters were passed
in New York, the summers in Cooperstown. Later
he made Otsego Hall his permanent home.</p>

<p>He soon became embroiled in quarrels with the
press. While in Paris his defence of Lafayette’s
position in what is known as the ‘Expenses Controversy’
had provoked from his native land criticism
which Cooper resented. He angered a part
of the inhabitants of Cooperstown by making clear
to them that Three Mile Point (a wooded tract
on the lake, long used by the villagers as a picnic
ground) was not theirs, as they maintained, but a
part of the Cooper estate. With no thought of
robbing them of their pleasure park, he insisted on
their understanding that they enjoyed its use by
favor and not by right.</p>

<p>For this the country papers assailed him. Combative
by nature, Cooper brought suits for libel
and recovered damages. The novel spectacle of
an author baiting the newspapers ‘caused remark.’
The city press joined in the attack, the ‘Courier
and Enquirer,’ the ‘New York Tribune,’ the
‘Albany Evening Journal,’ edited by Thurlow
Weed, who once said apropos of his skill in stirring
up litigation: ‘There is something in my
manner of writing that makes the galled jades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
wince.’ Verdicts were given in Cooper’s favor.
More libels followed, more suits were brought,
more damages recovered. A cry arose that the
liberty of the press was endangered. Cooper did
not think so. He was a bulldog; when he had
once fastened his teeth in a Whig editor, nothing
could make him let go. He continued his prosecutions
until he made his detractors respect him.
It took about six years to do it. Bryant has described
with grim humor the novelist’s warfare
with that leviathan the Press: ‘He put a hook
into the nose of this huge monster,’ said Bryant
admiringly.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>This warfare disturbed Cooper’s peace of mind,
but in no wise interrupted his literary activity.
The following list records by no means all that he
wrote after 1834, but will suffice to show his right
copious and often happy industry. Besides ten
volumes of travels, Cooper published: <i>A Letter
to his Countrymen</i>, 1834; <i>The Monikins</i>, 1835;
<i>The American Democrat</i>, 1838; <i>Homeward Bound,
or the Chase</i>, 1838; <i>Home as Found</i>, 1838; <i>The
History of the Navy of the United States of America</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
1839; <i>The Pathfinder, or the Inland Sea</i>, 1840;
<i>Mercedes of Castile, or the Voyage to Cathay</i>, 1840;
<i>The Deerslayer, or the First War Path</i>, 1841; The
<i>Two Admirals</i>, 1842; <i>The Wing-and-Wing, or
Le Feu-Follet</i>, 1842; <i>Wyandotté, or the Hutted
Knoll</i>, 1843; <i>Ned Meyers, or a Life before the
Mast</i>, 1843; <i>Afloat and Ashore, or the Adventures
of Miles Wallingford</i>, 1844; <i>Miles Wallingford</i>
(the second part of <i>Afloat and Ashore</i>), 1844;
<i>Satanstoe, or the Littlepage Manuscripts</i>, 1845;
<i>The Chainbearer, or the Littlepage Manuscripts</i>,
1846; <i>Lives of Distinguished American Naval
Officers</i>, 1846; <i>The Redskins, or Indian and Injin</i>,
1846; <i>The Crater, or Vulcan’s Peak</i>, 1847; <i>Jack
Tier, or the Florida Reefs</i>, 1848; <i>The Oak Openings,
or the Bee Hunter</i>, 1848; <i>The Sea Lions, or
the Lost Sealers</i>, 1849; <i>The Ways of the Hour</i>,
1850.</p>

<p><i>The Spy</i> was dramatized and played successfully.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
Dramatizations were also made of <i>The Pilot</i>, <i>The
Red Rover</i>, <i>The Water-Witch</i>, <i>The Pioneers</i> (‘The
Wigwam, or Templeton Manor’), and <i>The Wept
of Wish-ton-Wish</i> (‘Miantonomah and Narrahmattah’).
An original comedy, ‘Upside Down, or
Philosophy in Petticoats,’<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> was withdrawn after
four performances. No satisfactory account exists
of Cooper’s earnings by literature. It is believed
that in the later years he was obliged to write, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
not for the necessities of life, at least for the comforts
and luxuries.</p>

<p>The hostility provoked by his energetic criticisms
subsided in time. There was even a project
on foot in New York to pay him the compliment
of a public dinner as a proof of returning confidence.
His untimely illness put to one side the
question of honors of this poor sort.</p>

<p>Cooper died at Otsego Hall on September 14,
1851.</p>

<h3 id="sec_14">II<br />

<span class="subhead">HIS CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Cooper</span> was a democrat in theory but not in practice.
The rude ‘feudalism’ in which his boyhood
was passed fostered the aristocratic sentiment. A
residence abroad, in the obsequious atmosphere
with which the serving classes invest any one who
has the appearance of wealth, aggravated it. No
one could have been more heartily ‘American’
than Cooper; but he made distinctions and his
countrymen abhorred the distinctions.</p>

<p>Pride of this not unreasonable sort may go
hand in hand with genuine modesty. Cooper was
more unpretentious than his enemies were willing
to allow. With a reputation that would have
opened many doors he made no capital of it; he
had no mind ‘to thrust himself on all societies.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>He was never slow to make use of the inalienable
American privilege of speaking one’s
mind. In 1835 the theory of the entire perfection
of the American character was seldom challenged,
at least by a native writer. That Cooper should
entertain doubts on the subject was thought monstrous.
It was resented in him the more because
of his manner. Opinions quite as radical might
have been uttered wittily and the end accomplished.
Cooper had little wit. His touch was heavy and he
was in dead earnest. He lacked neither courage,
nor honesty, nor highmindedness, nor generosity,
nor yet judgment (if his temper was unruffled),
but he was entirely wanting in tact, and largely
wanting in geniality of the useful, if superficial,
sort, which lessens the wear and tear of human
intercourse.</p>

<p>A philosopher divides famous men into two
classes: those who are admired in their own homes
(as well as in the world), and those who are admired
anywhere but at home. Cooper belonged
to the first class rather than the second. This
proud, irascible, contentious, dogmatic man of
letters enjoyed the unswerving loyalty and deep
affection of every member of his family. And
from this his biographer argues an essential sweetness
of nature.</p>

<p>Cooper somewhere says: ‘Men are as much
indebted to a fortuitous concurrence of circumstances
for the characters they sustain in this world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
as to their personal qualities.’ It was his ill-luck
to have the accidents of his character often mistaken
for the character itself.</p>

<h3 id="sec_15">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WRITER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Cooper’s</span> English at best, though fluent and
spirited, is without grace; at worst it is clumsy
and intractable. This writer of world-wide fame
is singularly wanting in literary finish. He is not
careless but colorless, not slovenly but neutral.
He succeeds almost without the aid of what is
commonly called ‘style.’ He is read for what he
has to say, not for the way in which he says it.
There are surprises in store for the reader, but
they are not to be found in the perfect word, the
happy phrase, or the balance of a sentence, but
always in the unexpected turn of an adventure, in
a well-planned episode abounding in incident, in
the release of mental tension following the happy
issue out of danger. As was said of another copious
writer, ‘he weaves a loose web;’ one might
add that it is often of coarse fibre. In few writers
of eminence is form so subservient to contents.
The defect was due to haste, to the natural and
lordly contempt of a spontaneous story-teller for
the niceties of rhetoric.</p>

<span class="subhead">ROMANCES OF THE AMERICAN
REVOLUTION</span>

<span class="subhead"><i>THE SPY</i>, <i>LIONEL LINCOLN</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Life</span> in that unhappy strip of country known
during the Revolution as ‘the neutral ground,’
Westchester County, New York, is the subject
of <i>The Spy</i>. Here frequent and bloody encounters
took place between skirmishers from the opposing
armies. Marauding bands, ostensibly ‘loyal’ or
‘patriotic,’ though often composed of banditti,
made life a misery and a terror to peaceably inclined
householders. Cooper wrote from first-hand
traditions. The family of his wife had been loyalists,
and the most famous of Westchester County
raiders was a DeLancey.</p>

<p>The chief character is Harvey Birch, the Spy.
Professing to be in the employ of the British, he is
the most trusted of Washington’s secret agents. His
devotion to his chief is a passion, almost a religion.
Mean of appearance, niggardly in his mode of life,
he is capable of the last degree of personal sacrifice.
His patriotism is of the most exalted kind, since it
can have no proportionate reward. He must live
(perchance die) detested by the people for whom
he risks his life daily. Cooper makes us deeply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
interested in this uncouth being, who, persecuted
to the point of despair, and even brought to the
gallows, finds always a way of escape. Birch gambled
with his life in stake. It was a desperate throw
when he destroyed the bit of paper signed by
Washington.</p>

<p>The romantic hero of the story is Peyton Dunwoodie,
a youth whose ‘dark and sparkling glance’
played havoc with the hearts of impressionable
ladies. But Peyton was true, and loved but one.
More to the modern taste are the humors of Lawton
and Sitgreaves, of Sergeant Hollister and Betty
Flanagan. ‘Mr. Harper’ is impressive, and the
mystery of his character well sustained. The ladies
of ‘The Locusts’ have the quaint charm inseparable
from other-day manners and costume. To be
sure one of them, who seems likely to die of love,
is mercifully killed by a random bullet, and another
becomes a maniac. Novel-readers wanted a deal
for their money in 1821. But Frances Wharton
is a likable little creature, though her talk does
not in the least resemble that of Miss Clara Middleton.</p>

<p>As an Irish bishop said of <i>Gulliver’s Travels</i>,
the book contains improbabilities. The device of
a masque which converts young Henry Wharton
into the counterfeit presentment of an old gray-headed
negro is far-fetched. <i>The Spy</i> was not intended
to be a realistic novel.</p>

<p>Cooper projected another story on the background<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
of the Revolution. <i>Lionel Lincoln</i>, for all
the work put on it, was not a success. It had merits
among which the merit of spontaneity is not conspicuous.
Had the failure been less apparent, the
novelist might have been tempted to continue the
‘Legends of the Thirteen Republics.’</p>

<h3 id="sec_17">V<br />

<span class="subhead">THE LEATHER-STOCKING TALES AND
OTHER INDIAN STORIES</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">A French</span> critic once remarked that nothing was
so like a <i>chanson de geste</i> as another <i>chanson de
geste</i>. Readers have deplored the fact that nothing
was so like a Leather-Stocking tale as another
Leather-Stocking tale. But <i>The Pioneers</i>, the first
of the series in order of composition, bears little resemblance
to the others, and as a picture of life in
a New York village at the end of the Eighteenth
Century has a historical value. The narrative is
firm in texture. The characters are thirty in number,
and every man in his humor. The Judge,
Cousin Richard, Mr. Grant the clergyman, all the
town oddities, Monsieur Le Quoi, Major Hartmann,
Doolittle, Kirby, and Benjamin are real
and humanly interesting. The dialogue is fresh,
racy, and appropriate. There is no effort at compression;
winter evenings were long in 1824.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>The book holds one by the scenes and characters
rather than by the ‘fable.’ The mystery of
‘Edwards,’ and the coming to life of old Major
Effingham, are well enough; but the strength of the
story is in the episodes, such as that where Hiram
Doolittle, supported by Jotham and Kirby, tries
to serve the warrant on Natty Bumppo, in the
trial of the old hunter, or the capital scene where
Natty is put into the stocks, and the chivalrous
major-domo, Benjamin, insists on sharing his
punishment, and cheering the heart-broken old
man with comfortable and picturesque words.
Presently Doolittle came to enjoy the fruit of his
victory. Venturing too near, he found himself
in the tenacious grasp of the irate major-domo.
Benjamin’s legs were stationary, but his fists were
free, and he proceeded to work away with ‘great
industry’ on Mr. Doolittle’s face, ‘using one
hand to raise up his antagonist, while he knocked
him over with the other;’ he scorned to strike
a fallen adversary.</p>

<p><i>The Pioneers</i> would merit a high place in American
fiction were it only on account of that original
character, Natty Bumppo, or ‘Leather-Stocking.’
He is natural, easy, attractive. In the other books
(always excepting <i>The Prairie</i>), there is more of
invention. Putting it in another way, the first
Natty Bumppo is like a study from life, while the
others often leave the impression of being studies
from the first study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>By changing the background, the costume, the
accessories, and making his hero younger or older,
Cooper found him available for more exciting dramas
than that played in Templeton.</p>

<p>Leather-Stocking next appears as ‘Hawkeye,’
the scout, in <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>, a narrative
based on the massacre of Fort William Henry in
1757, and, all things considered, the most famous
of Cooper’s novels. It is an out-and-out Indian
story, good for boys and not bad for men, being
vigorous, brilliant, and packed with adventure.
The capture, by a band of Montcalm’s marauding
Iroquois, of the two daughters of the old Scottish
general, their rescue by Hawkeye, Chingachgook,
and Uncas, their recapture, the pursuit and the
thrilling events in the Indian villages, form the
staple of a book which without exaggeration may
be called world-renowned.</p>

<p>If <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> suffers from one
fault more than another, it is from a superabundance
of hair-breadth escapes. The novelist heaps
difficulties on difficulties, all of which appear insurmountable,
and are presently surmounted with
an ease that makes the reader half angry with himself
for having worried.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, in growing
younger Natty has grown theatrical; he appears
too exactly at the critical moment to perform the
deed of cool bravery expected of him. It could
hardly be otherwise; <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
a romance, and in romances such things must be.
Chingachgook, that engaging savage, has for so
many years met the romantic ideal of the American
Indian that it is unlikely he will ever be disturbed
in his place in the reader’s esteem. His rôle of
white man’s friend was played in <i>The Prairie</i> by
Hard-Heart, the young Pawnee chief.</p>

<p><i>The Prairie</i> has an originality all its own. This
strange and sombre tale brings together an oddly
assorted group of people, some of whom—the
squatter and his family in particular—are drawn
with rude strength. There are weak points in the
plot. The carefully guarded tent with its hidden
occupant is a poor device for compelling attention.
Dr. Battius, endlessly talkative about genus and
species, is a tiresome personage. The justification
of the story as a work of art is to be sought in
the descriptions of the ‘desert,’ in the impressions
given of immeasurable distance and illimitable
space, the abode of mystery and terror. The passages
describing the stampede of a herd of buffalo,
the night surprise of the trapper and his friends
by the Sioux, the escape of Hard-Heart from the
torture-stake, are all done with a masterly stroke.</p>

<p>Natty Bumppo figures in <i>The Prairie</i> as an
old man of eighty-seven. His eye has lost its
keenness of vision and his hand its steadiness.
But the heart is undaunted (‘Lord, what a strange
thing is fear!’) and the mind fertile in expedients.
At times the trapper appears in almost superhuman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
proportions; he is mythical, like a hero of
antiquity. The attachment between the ancient
hunter and his dog is exquisitely described. In
the beautiful account of Leather-Stocking’s last
hour no touch is more poetic than that where the
dying man discovers that the faithful Hector is
dead. He will not say that a Christian can hope
to meet his hound again; but he asks that Hector
be buried beside him; no harm, he thinks, can
come of that.</p>

<p>Thirteen years after the publication of <i>The
Prairie</i> appeared <i>The Pathfinder</i>, and one year
after that <i>The Deerslayer</i>. The series was now
complete, forming ‘something like a drama in five
acts.’ <i>The Pathfinder</i> shows Natty in mature
manhood, and (for the comfort of all who require
this test of their heroes of fiction) a victim of unrequited
love. Exposed to the wiles of the most
treacherous of all Mingos, Cupid, the quondam
hunter, hunted in turn, takes defeat like the man
he is. In <i>The Deerslayer</i> the chronicle is completed
with a group of scenes from Natty’s youth.
On the shores of Otsego Lake, while defending old
Hutter’s aquatic home, the young man learns the
first lessons in the art of war.</p>

<p>Cooper wrote yet other Indian stories. Two
may be taken note of in this section: <i>The Wept
of Wish-ton-Wish</i>, a narrative of the Connecticut
settlements in ‘King Philip’s’ time, and <i>Wyandotté</i>,
an episode of frontier life in 1775. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
latter is realistic. Cooper was on his own ground
and knew the Willoughby Patent and the Hutted
Knoll much as he knew ‘Templeton’ and Otsego
Lake. <i>The Wept of Wish-ton-Wish</i> is pure romance.
In spite of the labored speech of the
Puritan settlers and the metaphorical flights of
Metacom and Conanchet, the story is enthralling.
That is a genuinely pathetic scene where Ruth
Heathcote seeks to awaken in the mind of Narramattah,
her lost daughter, now the wife of the
Narragansett chief, some faint memory of her
childhood, and the account of Conanchet’s death
at the hands of the Mohicans is a strong and dramatic
piece of writing.</p>

<h3 id="sec_18">VI<br />

<span class="subhead">THE SEA STORIES</span>

<span class="subhead">FROM <i>THE PILOT</i> TO <i>MILES WALLINGFORD</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><i>The Pilot</i> is an imaginary episode in the life of
John Paul Jones. Cooper has given his hero a
poetic character. ‘Mr. Gray’ applies science to
the problem before him up to the critical moment,
and then trusts to intuition, to his genius, and
finds wind and wave owning him their master.
The new note is in the vivid descriptive passages,
couched in terms of practical seamanship, but so
graphically put that the most ignorant of lubbers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
can be depended on to read with a quickened
pulse. Notable among these are the rescue of the
frigate from the shoals, and the fight between the
‘Alacrity’ and ‘Ariel.’</p>

<p>There is much human nature in the speech
of the men if not of the women. The dialogue
between Borroughcliffe and Manual would not
shame books more celebrated for humor than <i>The
Pilot</i>. Vast refreshment can be found in the racy
and picturesque talk of Long Tom Coffin, the
most original character in Cooper’s gallery of seamen;
also in that of Boltrope, who from an early
‘prejudyce’ against knee-breeches (he somehow
always imagined Satan as wearing them) never became
fully reconciled to the ship’s chaplain until
that worthy left off ‘scudding under bare poles’
and garbed himself like other men. Dillon, the
lawyer, is too obviously the scoundrel. As the
‘Cacique of Pedee,’ however, he serves a good
end. His kinsman, Colonel Howard, walks the
stage with dignity, a worthy specimen of the loyalist
of the American Revolution, and typical of the
class for whom Cooper had much sympathy.</p>

<p>The young women are far from being lay figures.
They have beauty, intelligence, courage, even
audacity. That they are too perfect in feature,
form, manner, was a defect common to all fiction of
the time; the art of making a heroine of a plain
woman was in its infancy. Cooper, who could describe
a girl, had always a deal of trouble to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
her talk. Did he never listen to the conversation
of those interesting creatures known, in the parlance
of his day, as ‘females’? Would Alice
Dunscombe, meeting her lover after a separation
of six years, have used the phrases Cooper put
into her lips? All these young women might with
justice have complained that the speaking parts
assigned them were not representative. But they
were at the author’s mercy and did as they were
told.</p>

<p>Cooper’s principal biographer, to whom we are
all vastly indebted, says that ‘the female characters
of his earlier novels are never able to do
anything successfully but faint.’ This is unfair.
Katherine Plowden, a brunette beauty, whom
Professor Lounsbury has allowed himself to forget,
goes habited <i>en garçon</i> to seek her lover, and
does not faint when she finds him, only laughs
like the gay Rosalind she is.</p>

<p>The story of ‘Mr. Gray the pilot’ is good, but
<i>The Red Rover</i> is better. Cooper gave the public
something new in pirates. The old-fashioned corsair,
in theatrical phrase, looked his part. He
swore horribly, was awful to behold, black-whiskered,
visibly blood-stained, a walking stand of
arms, like the monsters described in Esquemeling’s
<i>Buccaneers of America</i>. Unlike L’Olonnois, of evil
memory, the captain of the ‘Dolphin’ is almost a
Brummell; his cabin is a boudoir, and he has the
wit to eschew the old-fashioned device of skull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
and cross-bones. One is inclined, however, to
laugh when the pirate ‘throws his form on a divan’
and bids music discourse. The Rover was somewhat
given to posing, and in moments of deep
thought wore a ‘look of faded marble.’</p>

<p>There is nothing fantastic in Wilder, the young
captain, and nothing to be desired in his handling
of the ‘Royal Caroline.’ The description of the
flight before the strange cruiser is a splendidly
nervous piece of writing. From the moment when
the Bristol trader disentangles herself from the
slaver’s side in the harbor of Newport until she
becomes a wreck on the high seas and the diabolical
pursuer passes like a hurricane, the interest is
cumulative.</p>

<p>The book has its quota of garrulous old salts,
some of whom talk too much, others not enough.
‘Mister Nightingale’ promises well, but has little
of value to say after his discourse anent the quantity
of sail a ship may carry in a white squall off
the coast of Guinea. The reader will find amusement
in the other characters, notably Fid and that
strange being, Scipio Africanus.</p>

<p><i>The Water-Witch</i> concerns a mysterious and
beautiful smuggling brigantine with a wonderful
gift for eluding Her Majesty’s revenue cruiser
under command of Captain Ludlow. The time
is the close of Lord Cornbury’s administration,
the scene, New York harbor and the adjacent
estuaries. The story is fantastic and melodramatic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
and the dialogue stilted, even for Cooper. Compared
with <i>The Red Rover</i>, a romance like <i>The
Water-Witch</i> is hard reading. With such characters
as Alderman Van Beverout, Alida de Barbérie,
and ‘Seadrift’ with her epicene beauty, it is not
surprising that <i>The Water-Witch</i> should have been
dramatized.</p>

<p><i>The Two Admirals</i> is an engaging picture of
manly affection. He who has made the acquaintance
of Sir Gervaise Oakes and his friend Richard
Bluewater is to be congratulated, for a more sterling-hearted
pair of worthies is seldom to be found.
Other pleasant company may be had for the asking;
the aged baronet Sir Wycherly Wychecombe,
hospitable to excess, bemoaning the inconvenience
of not having a satisfactory heir, and wondering
why his brother never married, though he had
never given himself the trouble to undergo the
discipline of wedlock. Agreeable in their several
ways are Mildred Dutton, Wycherly Wychecombe
the young Virginian, and Galleygo the top man
turned steward, he of the picturesque language. The
story has a conventional plot, and one is supposed
to be eager to know the validity of the Virginian’s
claim to the ancient estate of the Wychecombes.
The plot is in danger of being forgotten when
Cooper carries his people to sea, and describes the
action between French and English fleets off Cape
la Hogue.</p>

<p><i>Wing-and-Wing</i> relates the adventures of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
French privateer in the Mediterranean in 1798.
One has not to read far before becoming enamoured
of the diabolical little lugger and her audacious
captain. As creatures of romance go, the good-humored
and handsome Raoul Yvard (alias ‘Sir
Smees’) is real and attractive. His arguments
with Ghita (they talk theology not at all after
the manner of Mrs. Humphry Ward’s characters)
move one to turn the pages hurriedly. Raoul
may be forgiven; Ghita drove him to it, being
orthodox and fond of proselyting. One can always
take refuge with the vice-governatore and
the podestà. These worthies are long-winded, but
it were unfair to call them dull.</p>

<p>Ithuel Bolt, that long-legged, loose-jointed son
of the Granite State, is new in Cooper’s gallery
of seamen. He makes an interesting figure in the
wine-shop at Porto Ferrajo, his chair, creaking
under his weight, tipped back on two legs against
the wall, the uprights digging into the plaster, his
knees apart, ‘you fancy how,’ and his long arms
over the backs of neighboring chairs, giving him
a resemblance to a spread eagle. Next to the wine
of the country, which he abuses while succumbing
to its influence, he detests the saints. Filippo,
the Genoese sailor, undertakes a feeble defence.
Says the Yankee: ‘A saint is but a human—a
man like you and me, after all the fuss you
make about ’em. Saints abound in my country,
if you’d believe people’s account of themselves.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
Cooper says that Bolt, after his return to
America, became a deacon. This is no more incredible
than the statement that he also became a
teetotaler.</p>

<p>The pages of old reviews would probably show
how Cooper’s delineation of Englishmen affected
English readers. Our cousins over the water must
have been difficult if they quarrelled with the spirit
in which the portraits of Cuffe, Griffin, Winchester,
and Clinch were painted, all being good men and
true in their various capacities. In describing
Nelson and the ‘Lady Admiraless’ the novelist
undertook a difficult task. He was adroit enough
to avoid bringing the famous beauty too often on
the stage.</p>

<p><i>Afloat and Ashore</i> and <i>Miles Wallingford</i> form
a continuous story of almost a thousand pages.
There is a mixture of love and adventure, the love
being depicted as Cooper usually does it, neither
better nor worse, and the sea-episodes as only
Cooper could do them.</p>

<p>A capital passage in <i>Afloat and Ashore</i> is that
describing the encounter with the savages off the
coast of South America. Even more spirited are
those chapters of <i>Miles Wallingford</i> in which the
young captain of the ‘Dawn’ relates how he was
overhauled successively by a British man-of-war,
a French privateer, and a piratical lugger, and how
he escaped them all only to be wrecked at last in
the Irish Sea. Among a dozen or so of characters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
Marble is a typical Cooper seaman, a man of
many resources, as witness how he outwitted Sennit.
He was patriotic too, and on his first visit to
London was chagrined at being obliged to admit
that St. Paul’s was better than anything they had
in Kennebunk.</p>

<h3 id="sec_19">VII<br />

<span class="subhead">OLD-WORLD ROMANCE AND NEW-WORLD
SATIRE</span>

<span class="subhead"><i>THE BRAVO</i>, <i>THE HEIDENMAUER</i>, <i>THE HEADSMAN</i>,
<i>HOMEWARD BOUND</i>, <i>HOME AS FOUND</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><i>The Bravo</i> was the first of a group of stories on
themes suggested to their author during his stay
on the Continent. It deals with Venetian life during
the decline of the Republic. Jacopo Frontoni,
the reputed bravo, becomes party to the iniquitous
system which conceals crimes committed in
the interest of the oligarchy, by throwing the suspicion
on himself, all to the end that he may save
his aged father, unjustly imprisoned by the state.
Under this odium Jacopo lives until life becomes
unendurable. At the moment he is meditating
flight he is himself enmeshed in the toils and dies
by the hand of the public executioner. A power
which holds that it can do no wrong has a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
way with servants who might betray its tortuous
policy.</p>

<p>Jacopo comes too near to being a saint. He
would have been more lifelike had he been guilty
of one at least of the twenty-five murders laid at
his door. Even a hired assassin of the Fifteenth
Century might show filial piety.</p>

<p>His fate more or less involves that of the old
fisherman of the lagoons, Antonio, a representative
of that helpless, oppressed class which is without
rights save the right of being punished if it
does not obey. Antonio is a nobly pathetic character,
one of the finest to which Cooper’s imagination
has given being. His patience, his love for
the grandchild taken from him by the state to
serve in the galleys, his courage in pleading before
the Doge and even in the dread presence of the
Council of Three that the boy may be given back
to him until he has been formed in habits of virtue,
are strong and beautiful traits.</p>

<p>Violetta and Don Camillo furnish the love
motive, without which a romance of Venice were
barren. We sympathize with them and rejoice in
their escape. More than this the author could not
ask.</p>

<p>That the story contains anachronisms admits of
no doubt. It may be that the arraignment of the
oligarchy is too unrelieved. On the other hand,
the virtues of the narrative are many. The movement
is rapid, the sentences clear, the various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
strands of interest artfully woven, and the conclusion
inevitable and dramatic.</p>

<p><i>The Heidenmauer</i> deals with the manners and
the antagonisms of the time when the schism of
Luther was undermining the Church. Far less engrossing
than its predecessor and weighted with
a cumbrous style, the book has its right valiant
warriors and militant churchmen, its burghers,
peasants, and other dramatis personæ of German
romance. There are characters like Gottlob and
old Ilse whose speech is always fresh and agreeable.
The French abbé is voluble and might have
been wittier. That one does not sit down to a table
spread with an intellectual feast like that served
in <i>The Monastery</i> or <i>The Abbot</i>, is no reason for
disdaining the fare served in <i>The Heidenmauer</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>The Headsman</i> we follow the story of a highborn
girl who has given her heart to a young soldier
of fortune only to discover in him the son of
that most loathed of beings, the official executioner
of Berne. The office is hereditary, and were the
youth’s real condition known the odious duties
would in time fall on him. It is a foregone conclusion
that Sigismund shall be found to be of
noble birth, and Adelheid’s reward proportioned
to the greatness of her soul. This is but one thread
of a fairly complicated and romantic plot. The
interest of the narrative is well sustained and the
denouement unanticipated. None of these three
romances is, strictly speaking, a novel of purpose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
and the least attractive deserves friendlier critical
treatment than is commonly accorded it.</p>

<p>In the same group may be placed <i>Mercedes of
Castile</i>, which, if it cannot hold the attention by
reason of the loves of Don Luis de Bobadilla and
Mercedes, and the fate of the unfortunate Ozema,
may be read (by whoever can take history well
diluted with fiction) for the story of Columbus’s
first voyage.</p>

<p><i>The Monikins</i> contrasts the ways of men with
the ways of monkeys, much to the disadvantage
of men. Really it is no duller than some of the
professed satire of the present day; it is merely
longer and more desperately serious.</p>

<p><i>Homeward Bound</i> and <i>Home as Found</i> form two
parts of a single novel. The satire of the first part
is forgotten in the movement of the narrative, the
sea-chase, the wreck off the African coast, the fight
with the Arabs. The second part is a diatribe on
New York and Cooperstown in particular, and
America in general. The chief characters, the
Effinghams, mean well, but ‘they have an unfortunate
manner,’ and their disagreeable traits are
not so piquant as to be entertaining. Steadfast
Dodge, the editor, is almost as unreal as the Effinghams.
Captain Truck is a genuine brother man,
resourceful as master of the ‘Montauk,’ and not
helpless when figuring (without his connivance)
as a great English author, at Mrs. Legend’s literary
soirée.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>Horatio Greenough had the ‘Effingham’ books
in mind when he wrote to Cooper: ‘I think you
lose hold on the American public by rubbing
down their shins with brickbats as you do.’</p>

<h3 id="sec_20">VIII<br />

<span class="subhead">TRAVELS, HISTORY, POLITICAL WRITINGS
AND LATEST NOVELS</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Cooper</span> was a giant of productivity. Some brief
comment has been made on twenty-three of his
novels. It is impossible in the limits of this study
to do much beyond giving the titles of his remaining
books.</p>

<p><i>The History of the Navy of the United States of
America</i> begins with ‘the earliest American sea-fight’
(May, 1636), when John Gallop in a sloop
of twenty tons captured a pinnace manned by
thieving Indians, and closes with the War of 1812.
The noteworthy features of the book are accuracy,
independence, severity of style, and freedom from
spread-eagleism. The brief <i>Chronicles of Cooperstown</i>,
written in a plain way, has the natural interest
attaching to the subject and the author.</p>

<p><i>A Letter to his Countrymen</i>, partly autobiographical,
is absorbing in its bitter earnestness.
<i>The Travelling Bachelor</i> purports to be the letters
of a cosmopolite, a man of fifty, to various members<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
of his club, recounting his travels in the
United States. The book is historical, statistical,
argumentative. It treats of government, manners,
art, literature, of fashions in dress and of peculiarities
of speech. As an attempt on the part of a
man of strong prejudices to take an objective view
of his own country, it is singularly interesting.
Were its seven hundred closely printed pages
lightened with humor or relieved by any grace of
expression, <i>The Travelling Bachelor</i> would be a
vastly entertaining work.</p>

<p><i>The American Democrat</i> is a collection of short
essays, forty-five in number, on the American republic,
liberty, parties, public opinion, property,
the press, demagogues, the decay of manners, individuality,
aristocrat and democrat, pronunciation,
slavery, etc., etc. The tone of the comments is
intentionally censorious, and often proves exasperating.
Having been long absent from America,
Cooper found himself to a certain degree ‘in the
situation of a foreigner in his own country.’ On
this account he was prepared to note peculiarities.
Praise and blame are mingled. <i>The American
Democrat</i> sets forth high ideals, as may be seen, for
example, in the suggestive essay on party. The
book is courageous but wanting in suavity.</p>

<p><i>Sketches of Switzerland</i> and <i>Gleanings in Europe</i>,
comprising ten volumes in the original editions,
are studies of Continental and English life. They
contain a multitude of spirited, pungent, and true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
observations. Lacking the ‘antiseptic of style,’
the books are no longer read.</p>

<p>Between 1845 and 1850 Cooper published eight
novels. Three of the eight, <i>Satanstoe</i>, <i>The Chainbearer</i>,
and <i>The Redskins</i>, are narratives supposed
to be drawn from the ‘Littlepage Manuscripts.’
The first is not only the best, but is also one of the
most genial of all Cooper’s novels. Corny Littlepage
had attractive friends, such as the mettlesome
youth Guert Ten Eyck, a splendid specimen of
the free-handed, royally generous Dutch-American.
Jason Newcome, on the other hand, embodies
Cooper’s never latent hostility to New England.
The pictures of old days in New York and Albany
are brilliant and highly finished, and the encounter
with the Indians in Cooper’s most spirited vein.</p>

<p><i>The Crater</i> is a history of the adventures of
Mark Woolston of Bristol, Bucks County, Pennsylvania,
who was shipwrecked on a volcanic island
in the Pacific, and with the able seaman Bob Betts
set himself to solve the problem of existence.
What with gardening, poultry-raising, boat-building,
tempests, earthquakes, exploration of neighboring
islands, colonization, savages, and pirates,
the book resolves itself into one of the infinite
variations of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. After twenty-nine
chapters of this sort of thing comes an absurd and
irrelevant conclusion.</p>

<p>All the later novels, <i>Jack Tier</i>, <i>The Sea Lions</i>,
<i>Oak Openings</i>, and <i>The Ways of the Hour</i>, are hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
reading, yet the least happy of them has passages
betraying the master’s hand. <i>The Sea Lions</i> stands
out by virtue of the powerful descriptions of an
Antarctic winter; but neither Captain Spike’s mission
to the gulf, nor the revelation of fat, profane
Jack’s true station and sex, nor yet the malapropisms
of Mrs. Budd (she would say ‘It blew what
they call a Hyson in the Chinese seas’), can make
<i>Jack Tier</i> more than tolerable.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Cooper’s greatest achievements were his stories
of the sea and the forest. His real creations are
sailors, backwoodsmen, old soldiers, and Indians.
Whether his red men are conceived in the spirit
of modern ethnological science can matter but little
now. They are neither so close to Chateaubriand’s
idealized savage, nor so far from the real
Indian as is generally believed. That Cooper had
no skill in representing contemporary society is
plain enough; but the failure of <i>Home as Found</i>
need not have been as complete as it was. Haste
and anger must bear the blame of that literary
disaster. Where he deals with manners of the
past, as in <i>Satanstoe</i>, he is often most felicitous.
With his novel of <i>The Bravo</i> he was in line with
the Romantic movement. How far he comprehended
that movement, or was influenced by it,
is a more intricate problem.</p>

<p>Modern literature can show but few authors
more popular than Cooper. He has been praised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
extravagantly; but the fact that Miss Mitford
thought him as good as Scott ought not to prejudice
us against him. And he has been damned
without measure; but over against Mark Twain’s
unchivalrous attack on his great fellow countryman
may be set the royally generous tributes of
Balzac and of Dumas.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Bancrofts have been settled in America
since 1632. Among the historian’s ancestors
were men of marked traits of character. Bancroft’s
grandfather, a farmer of Essex County, Massachusetts,
had such a reputation for piety and judgment
that he was called on to act as an umpire in
the bitter dispute between Jonathan Edwards and
his church at Northampton.</p>

<p>The father of the historian, Aaron Bancroft, a
pioneer of American Unitarianism, was for fifty
years pastor of the Second Church of Worcester.
His distinguishing trait was ‘a deep-seated abhorrence
of anything like mental slavery.’ He was
an ardent student of American history and the author
of an <i>Essay on the Life of George Washington</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
(1807), a popular book in its own day and well worth
the reading in ours. George Bancroft thought ‘that
his own inclination toward history was due very
much to the influence of his father.’</p>

<p>There is a story (probably apocryphal) that
in his youth Aaron Bancroft fought at Lexington
and Bunker Hill. During Shays’s Rebellion, when
the insurgent officers proposed to quarter themselves
in private houses at Worcester, the minister
guarded his own door and told a group of officers
who approached that they were rebels, and that
‘they would obtain no entrance to his house but
by violence.’ The officers immediately rode away.</p>

<p>George Bancroft was born at Worcester on
October 3, 1800. He prepared for college at Phillips
Academy, Exeter, New Hampshire, and was
graduated at Harvard in 1817. Edward Everett,
the newly appointed professor of Greek, who was
then studying at Göttingen, urged President Kirkland
to send some graduate of marked powers to
Germany with a view to his preparing himself to
teach at Harvard. The choice fell on Bancroft.
He spent two years at Göttingen and obtained his
doctorate. Among his professors were Heeren,
Dissen, Eichhorn, and Blumenbach; Heeren’s influence
was the most profound and the most lasting.
His range of studies was wide, including, as it
did, history, German literature, Greek philosophy,
natural history, Scripture interpretation, Arabic,
Syriac, and Persian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>From Göttingen, Bancroft went to Berlin, where
he heard the lectures of Savigny, Schleiermacher,
and Hegel, and made the acquaintance of Voss,
W. von Humboldt, and F. A. Wolf. He had the
fortune to meet Goethe once at Jena, and again at
Weimar. After leaving Berlin he studied for a
time at Heidelberg under Von Schlosser. In Paris
he met Cousin, Constant, and A. von Humboldt.
He travelled in Switzerland and Italy, and spent
the winter of 1821–22 at Rome, where he made
the acquaintance of Niebuhr and Bunsen. At Leghorn
the following spring he was one of a party of
Americans who gathered to meet Byron when the
poet visited the ‘Constitution,’ the flagship of the
American squadron. Bancroft afterwards called on
Byron at Montenero, and was presented to the
Countess Guiccioli.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1822 Bancroft became a tutor of
Greek at Harvard. The following year he resigned
his position, not to enter the ministry in accordance
with his father’s wishes, but to become a
schoolmaster. He joined his friend, Joseph G.
Cogswell (the directing spirit in the enterprise),
in founding a school for boys at Round Hill,
Northampton. Emerson, then a youth of twenty,
heard Bancroft preach at the ‘New South’ in Boston
soon after his return from Germany, and was
‘delighted with his eloquence.’ ‘He needs a great
deal of cutting and pruning, but we think him an
infant Hercules.’ Emerson deplored Bancroft’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
new departure, ‘because good schoolmasters are
as plenty as whortleberries, but good ministers
assuredly are not, and Bancroft might be one of
the best.’</p>

<p>On the eve of leaving Cambridge, Bancroft
published, under the title of <i>Poems</i>, a volume of
correct if not inspired verse. At Northampton
his literary activity found more sober expression
in text-books, in papers for the ‘North American
Review’ and Walsh’s ‘American Quarterly,’ and
in a careful translation of Heeren’s <i>Politics of Ancient
Greece</i> (1824). At the celebration of Independence
Day at Northampton in 1826, Bancroft
was the orator. He chanted the present glory of
America, predicted a golden future, and declared
his faith in a ‘determined uncompromising democracy.’
These notes were to be heard again and
often in his great history.</p>

<p>Round Hill, though prosperous in many ways,
was not a success financially, nor were the partners
wholly congenial. After seven years Bancroft withdrew
from the school and began writing the book
on which his fame rests. In 1834 appeared the
first volume of <i>A History of the United States from
the discovery of the American continent to the present
time</i>. The second volume was published in 1837,
the third in 1840.</p>

<p>The historian removed to Springfield and became
prominent in state politics. He was an ardent
Democrat and a strong opponent of slavery.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
Elected without his knowledge to the legislature,
he refused to take his seat; he also declined a
nomination to the senate. It is said that he took
this attitude with respect to office-holding out of
deference to the feelings of his wife, Sarah (Dwight)
Bancroft, who came of a prominent Whig family.
Mrs. Bancroft died in 1837.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Appointed Collector
of the Port of Boston by President Van Buren,
Bancroft held the office from 1838 to 1841, and
administered its affairs with a thoroughness theretofore
unknown, and in a way incidentally to reflect
great credit on the profession of letters.</p>

<p>In 1844 Bancroft was the Democratic candidate
for governor of Massachusetts and polled a large
vote, but was defeated by George N. Briggs. A
year later he became Secretary of the Navy under
President Polk. In the exercise of his duties he
gave the order to take possession of California, and
as acting Secretary of War the order to General
Taylor to occupy Texas.</p>

<p>During his secretaryship Bancroft founded the
United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. This
he brought about not by asking Congress to authorize
its establishment, but by so interpreting
the powers granted him under the law that he was
able to set in operation a school for the training of
midshipmen and offer it to Congress for approval.
Once the school was established and its usefulness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
proved, there was no difficulty in securing funds
for adequate equipment. The Academy was formally
opened on October 10, 1845.</p>

<p>From 1846 to 1849 Bancroft was minister to
England. There were important diplomatic problems
to be solved, but his triumphs were chiefly
literary and social. He accumulated a rich store of
documents, and on his return to America made
his home in New York and devoted himself anew
to the <i>History</i>.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> The fourth volume appeared in
1852; the fifth in 1853; the sixth in 1854; the
seventh in 1858; the eighth in 1860; the ninth in
1866; the tenth and concluding volume in 1874.
His <i>Literary and Historical Miscellanies</i> appeared
in 1855.</p>

<p>When the New York Historical Society celebrated
the close of the first half-century of its existence
(1854), Bancroft was the orator. His address
on that occasion, ‘The Necessity, the Reality,
and the Promise of the Progress of the Human
Race,’ has been pronounced the best exposition
of his historical creed.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Bancroft was a strong Union man and during the
Civil War acted with the Republican party. He
declined a nomination to Congress from the eighth
district of New York (October, 1862), on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
ground that a multiplication of candidates would
leave the result very much to chance; there should
be a union, he urged, of all those ‘who feel deeply
for their country in this her hour of peril.’ At
the close of the war he was chosen to pronounce
the eulogy on Lincoln before Congress (February,
1866).</p>

<p>President Johnson, in 1867, appointed Bancroft
minister to Prussia. Later he was accredited to the
North German Confederation, and in 1872, following
current political changes, to the German
Empire. He brought about that notable treaty
whereby Germans who had become citizens of the
United States were freed from allegiance to the
land of their birth. Never before by a ‘formal act’
had the principle of ‘renunciation of citizenship at
‘the will of the individual been recognized.’ England
followed Germany’s example and gave over
her claim of indefeasible allegiance. Another diplomatic
triumph was the settlement of the North-western
boundary dispute. While in Germany
Bancroft celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of his
graduation at Göttingen. The University gave
him an honorary degree, and congratulations were
showered on him from scholars, statesmen, princes,
and men of letters.</p>

<p>After nearly eight years of service Bancroft was
recalled from the German mission at his own request.
He lived in Washington during the winter
months and spent the summers at Newport as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
had long been his habit. The work of his later
years included two revisions of the <i>History</i> (1876
and 1884), a <i>History of the Formation of the Constitution
of the United States</i> (1882), <i>A Plea for
the Constitution of the United States of America,
wounded in the House of its Guardians</i> (1886), and
a sketch of the public life of Martin Van Buren
(1889).</p>

<p>Bancroft died in Washington on January 17,
1891.</p>

<h3 id="sec_22">II<br />

<span class="subhead">HIS CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Bancroft’s</span> character was fashioned on a large
scale. His mental horizon was broad, his power
to plan and carry out a vast undertaking was commensurate
with the reach of his vision. There was
little in his habit of thought to suggest the narrowness
so often associated with the name of scholar.
Yet he had the infinitely laborious powers of
the mere scholar. He could toil with unflagging
energy day by day or year by year.</p>

<p>The magisterial note in his historical writings is
due not alone to the subject or to the literary manner,
but also to the deliberate tenacity of purpose
with which the historian wrought. Such a work is
the product, not of feverish spasms of intellectual
activity, but of even and steady effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>Bancroft has been accused of a want of enthusiasm
in receiving critical observations on his work.
It is a question whether historians (more than philosophers)
are wont to receive with rapture proofs
that they are possibly in the wrong. Bancroft’s
tone of controversy is perhaps less peculiar to himself
than is commonly asserted. However, it must
be kept in mind that he had a ‘strong nervous
personality.’</p>

<p>Emerson described the greeting he had from
Bancroft in London. When he presented himself
at the minister’s door, ‘it was opened by Mr. Bancroft
himself in the midst of servants whom that
man of eager manners thrust aside, saying that he
would open his own door for me. He was full of
goodness and talk.’ Other accounts of him give
an impression of much stateliness of manner tempered
by affability. Still others convey the idea
that he was always artificial, and sometimes playful
with a playfulness that bordered on frivolity.
A friend<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> professed to detect in Bancroft’s bearing
marks of the man of letters, diplomat, politician,
preacher and pedagogue, one trait superimposed
on another. But the blend of characteristics was
charming.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_23">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WRITER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> charge brought against Bancroft of having
embellished his themes with ‘cheap rhetoric’ is
unjust. Rhetorical the historian undoubtedly was,
but the rhetoric was not cheap. It had the merit
of sincerity; it was the result of an honest effort
to present important facts and comments in becoming
garb.</p>

<p>In 1834 the style thought appropriate to historical
writing was markedly oratorical. Historians
addressed their readers. A pomp of expression,
something almost liturgical, was held seemly if not
indeed of last importance. Reading their works,
one involuntarily calls up a vision of grave gentlemen
in much-wrinkled frock-coats, making stilted
gestures, and looking even more unreal than their
statues which now terrify posterity. Bancroft was
affected by the prevailing drift towards oratorical
forms. At times one is tempted to exclaim: ‘This
was not meant to be read but to be heard.’</p>

<p>Take for example this passage on Sebastian
Cabot: ‘He lived to an extreme old age and loved
his profession to the last; in the hour of death
his wandering thoughts were upon the ocean.
The discoverer of the territory of our country was
one of the most extraordinary men of his age;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
there is deep cause for regret that time has spared
so few memorials of his career. Himself incapable
of jealousy, he did not escape detraction. He
gave England a continent, and no one knows his
burial place.’</p>

<p>Not to enter into the question whether this is
good, or indifferent, or even bad writing, it is sufficient
to note that the passage in question belongs
to spoken discourse rather than to literature. It
appeals to us, if at all, through the medium of the
ear rather than the eye.</p>

<p>Take for another example the comparison of
Puritan and Cavalier: Historians have loved to
eulogize ‘the manners and virtues, the glory and
the benefits of chivalry. Puritanism accomplished
for mankind far more. If it had the sectarian
crime of intolerance, chivalry had the vices of
dissoluteness. The knights were brave from gallantry
of spirit; the puritans from the fear of God.
The knights were proud of loyalty, the puritans
of liberty. The knights did homage to monarchs,
in whose smile they beheld honor, whose rebuke
was the wound of disgrace; the puritans, disdaining
ceremony, would not bend the knee to the
King of kings. The former valued courtesy; the
latter justice. The former adorned society by
graceful refinements; the latter founded national
grandeur on universal education. The institutions
of chivalry were subverted by the gradually
increasing weight, and knowledge, and opulence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
of the industrious classes; the puritans, relying
on those classes, planted in their hearts the undying
principles of democratic liberty.’</p>

<p>Passages such as these are often employed as a
rhetorical flourish at the end of a chapter. They
are analogous to what actors call ‘making a good
exit.’ In Bancroft they constitute for pages together
the prevailing rather than the exceptional
form. The reader, whether conscious of it or not,
is kept on a strain. At last he grows uncomfortable.
He wishes the historian would cease to declaim,
would come down from the rostrum, throw
aside his academic robes, and be neighborly and
familiar.</p>

<p>This <i>History</i> was so long in the writing that
Bancroft’s style changed materially. The opinion
prevails that his diction improved as the work proceeded,
that the later volumes are uniformly less
inflated, strained, and ‘eloquent’ than the earlier
ones. It is true that he made innumerable revisions
of the text. The changes were not always
improvements. Sometimes in rewriting a sentence
he made it less energetic. Strong expressions were
softened. A plain old-fashioned word would be
taken out; often it carried the whole phrase with
it. Whether the literary or the historical sense
dictated the change in question cannot always be
determined.</p>

<p>Bancroft’s diction is manly and forceful, but it
lacks natural grace and suppleness; it is flexible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
as chain armor is flexible, but not as is the human
body. It may be doubted whether he is ever
read for literary pleasure. Nevertheless, scattered
through these twelve volumes are hundreds of
passages well worth the study of those who enjoy
an exhibition of mastery in the use of words.</p>

<h3 id="sec_24">IV<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">One</span> does well to read Bancroft in the tall, wide-margined,
and almost sumptuous volumes of the
original editions. The page is open and inviting.
Both text and notes have a personal flavor very
diverting at times. There is no question as to the
usefulness of an attractive page in works of this
sort. Political histories should be made easy, not
by picture-book methods, but by the legitimate
arts of good printing.</p>

<p>The work is generously planned. Twelve octavo
volumes are required to bring the narrative down
to the ratification of the constitution.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Three volumes,
comprising nearly fifteen hundred pages, are
given to the Colonial period alone.</p>

<p>Bancroft announced his theory of historical writing
in the preface of 1834. He was to be controlled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
always by ‘the principles of historical scepticism,’
and his narrative was to be drawn ‘from writings
and sources which were contemporaries of the
events that are described.’ Nothing commonly
supposed to belong to American history was to be
retained merely because it had been unchallenged
by former historians.</p>

<p>The treatment, as shown in these volumes on
the Colonial period, is in perfect accord with the
author’s conception of the dignity of the subject.
The matter is as stately as the manner. Bancroft
writes history as a lord high chamberlain conducts
a court function. He feels that during the ceremony
of discovering a world and planting a nation
there should be no unseemliness, certainly no
laughter or disturbance.</p>

<p>The characters go through their evolutions like
well-drilled courtiers. So stately are they as to
appear scarce human. Homely and familiar traits
are almost completely suppressed. The founders
of America, as we see them looming in the pages of
Bancroft, are not men but incarnate ideas. They
are the embodiment of principles and virtues.
Winthrop is enlightened conservatism, Vane is
generous impetuosity, Roger Williams is liberty
of conscience. Strive how we will to bring these
men nearer, to make them tangible, the effort is
not wholly successful. These figures of the past,
like the characters of a morality-play, persist in
remaining personified ideas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<p>As a reaction against ‘classical’ history comes
history of the gossiping school. ‘Thanks to you,’
said Brunetière, welcoming Masson to the French
Academy, ‘we now know the exact number of
Napoleon’s shirts.’ Bancroft was not interested
in the spindles and shoe-buckles of the Puritans.
Many people are, but they must find elsewhere
the gratification they seek. Whoever wishes at any
time absolutely to escape anecdotage, homely detail,
and piquant gossip, has it always in his power
to do so; he can read Bancroft’s three volumes on
the Colonial period and dwell among abstractions.</p>

<p>Even if not at this stage of his career the most
human of writers, Bancroft is a comforting historian
to return to, after having dwelt for a while with
those who instruct us how low and mercenary in
motive, how impervious to liberal ideas, were the
men who planted English civilization in America.
Historical iconoclasts all, they are frightfully convincing.
Some of their arguments lose a degree of
force as it dawns on the reader that Seventeenth-century
men are being judged by Nineteenth-century
standards. When Bancroft wrote, the habit
of abusing the ancestors had not become deep-seated.</p>

<p>Turning from the Colonial period, the historian
takes up the period of the American Revolution.
Seven volumes are required for telling the story.
The logical arrangement is by ‘epochs.’ They are
four in number: ‘Overthrow of the European<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
Colonial system,’ ‘How Great Britain estranged
America,’ ‘America declares itself independent,’
‘The Independence of America is acknowledged.’<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>General histories must treat of many things, the
doings of authorized and representative assemblies
and the doings of the mob, skirmishes, battles by
land and sea, diplomatic intrigues, party combinations,
political and military plots, the characters of
the actors in the historic drama, and the setting
of the stage on which they played. While doing
all parts of his task with workmanlike skill, a historian
will be found to excel in this thing or in
that. Bancroft’s accounts of military operations are
always clear, energetic, and often extremely readable.
He could not, like Irving, ‘render you a
fearful battle in music,’ but he never made the
mistake of supposing that he could. He had not
the graphical power of Parkman, but he had enough
for his purposes.</p>

<p>His character sketches of the men who figured
in the struggles for American independence are
among the best parts of his writing. The patriots
and their friends in England and on the Continent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
are too uniformly creatures of light, but their opponents
are not represented as necessarily creatures
of darkness. If Bancroft could be more than fair
to his own side, he was incapable of being wholly
unfair to the other. His tendency is to regard
human character as all of a piece, fixed rather than
fluctuating. Men (politicians included) have been
known to grow in virtue as they grow in years.
Bancroft was over complacent in his attitude towards
frenzied impromptu Revolutionary gatherings
whose motives could not always have been
so guiltlessly patriotic and disinterested as he represents
them.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> He was but little versed in the
psychology of mobs.</p>

<p>Forceful at all points, Bancroft was singularly
impressive in dealing with history as it is made in
parliaments and conventions, in council chambers,
cabinets, and courts of law. He was born to grapple
with whole state paper offices. He knew the
secret of subordinating a vast amount of detail
to his main purpose. An important part of the
American Revolution took place in Europe. Bancroft’s
capital merit consists in his having brought
the event into its largest relations. The story as
he told it did not merely concern the uprising of
a few petty quarrelsome colonies, it became an important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
chapter in the history of liberty. Not for
an instant did he permit himself to lose sight of that
‘idea of continuity which gives vitality to history.’</p>

<p>It is wonderful how through these seven volumes
everything bends to one idea; how it all
becomes part of a demonstration, a detail in the
history of that spirit which, acting through discontent,
led first to local outbreak and resistance, then
to concerted action and war, and finally to the birth
of a new nation.</p>

<p>The crown of Bancroft’s work is the story of how
the states parted with so much of their individuality
as stood in the way of union, and then united. Two
volumes would seem to afford room for full and
leisurely treatment. But in fact the historian only
accomplished his task by enormous compression.
Often the substance of a speech had to be given in
a sentence, and the deliberations of days in a few
paragraphs. The marshalling of facts, the grasp of
the subject in detail and as a whole, are extraordinary.
Bancroft notes what forces led to union
and what opposed it. He marks the shifting of
public sentiment, the trembling of the balance,
but he grants himself few privileges of the sort
called literary. Seldom dramatic or picturesque
in this portion of his narrative, he is at all times
logically exact and magisterial.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>There is a peculiar fitness in the word ‘monumental’
applied to Bancroft’s work. It has solidity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
strength, durability, a massive and stately grandeur.
It is a book which the modern reader finds
it easy to neglect; but he puts it in his library and
never fails to commend it to his friends, with a
hypocritical expression of surprise at their not being
better acquainted with it. The truth is, we are
spoiled by more attractive historians. Macaulay,
Froude, and Parkman have made us indolent,
fond of verbal comforts and disinclined to effort.
We demand not only to be instructed but to be
vastly entertained at the same time. Bancroft certainly
instructs; it would be difficult to prove that
he also entertains.</p>

<p>His tone of confident eulogy is often condemned.
On the whole, this is a merit rather than a fault.
Doubtless he admired too uniformly and too much.
Many writers have taken pleasure in showing that
his admiration was misplaced. And thus a balance
is kept. It is a fortunate thing for American literature
that Bancroft’s vast work, destined to so wide
an influence, and the fruit of such immense labor,
should have been conceived and written in a generous
and hopeful spirit. The English reviewer who
on the appearance of the first volume praised the
historian because he was ‘so fearlessly honest and
impartial’ might also have praised him because
he was so fearlessly optimistic. This too requires
courage.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Prescotts are an ancient family as antiquity
is reckoned in the United States. The first
Anglo-American of that name, John Prescott, an
old Cromwellian soldier, took up residence in this
country about 1640, and after living awhile at
Watertown, Massachusetts, made a permanent
home for himself at Lancaster, then a frontier settlement.
When thieving Indians plundered him,
it is said that he used to put on helmet, gorget,
and cuirass, and start in pursuit. Being a powerful
man and stern of countenance, his terrific appearance
in his armor had a salutary effect on the
red men.</p>

<p>Jonas Prescott, a son of the old warrior, settled
at Groton, Massachusetts, and there the family
history centres for more than a hundred years.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
They were a vigorous race, useful and conspicuous
in the military and civil affairs of the colony.</p>

<p>William Hickling Prescott, the historian, was
born in Salem, Massachusetts, on May 4, 1796.
His father, Judge William Prescott, was a man
of eminent abilities, esteemed for his great legal
acquirements and beloved for his personal worth.
His mother, Catharine Hickling, a daughter of
Thomas Hickling of Boston, was distinguished
for energy and benevolence, as well as for a certain
gayety of temperament, a trait which she transmitted
to her famous son. The grandfather of the
historian was Colonel William Prescott, founder
of the town of Pepperell, who, on the night of
June 16, 1775, with his force of a thousand men,
threw up a redoubt on Bunker (Breed’s) Hill, and
on the following day defended it until defence was
no longer possible.</p>

<p>Prescott was drilled in the classics by one of old
Parr’s pupils, the Reverend Doctor John Gardiner,
rector of Trinity Church, Boston. He was an insatiable
reader of books; but it were idle to assume
that his interest in Spanish history and literature
took its first impulse, as has been asserted, from
the reading of Southey’s translation of <i>Amadis of
Gaul</i>.</p>

<p>He entered Harvard College in the Sophomore
year and was graduated in 1814. A misfortune
befell him early in his course which changed his
whole life and made enormous demands on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
philosophy and courage. In one of the frolics attending
the breaking up of commons, when small
missiles were flying about the room, Prescott was
struck full in the left eye with a hard crust of
bread. The sight was instantly destroyed, and he
lived for years in apprehension of what, fortunately,
never overtook him, total blindness.</p>

<p>He began the study of law, but illness and consequent
weakening of the power of vision put an
end to it. In search of health and diversion he
went abroad. After spending some months in the
Azores, in the family of his maternal grandfather,
Thomas Hickling, then United States consul at
St. Michael’s, he visited Italy, France, and England.
In London he consulted eminent oculists,
who were able, however, to give him but little
encouragement.</p>

<p>Shortly after his return home he married Miss
Susan Amory of Boston, whose maternal grandfather,
Captain Linzee, was in command of a British
sloop of war at the outbreak of the Revolution,
and had cannonaded the redoubt on Bunker Hill.
In 1821 Prescott planned a course of literary study.
Beginning oddly enough with grammars and rhetorics,
he followed this preliminary reading with a
wide survey first of English literature, then of
French and Italian. German he tried and gave
up. With his enfeebled sight he could do but
little of the actual reading for himself; the bulk
of it had to be done for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<p>Prescott’s literary life was peculiar in that he
prepared himself to become a man of letters with
no definite conception of what he would write
about. He was not, like the literary heroes of
whom we read, so possessed of his subject from
boyhood that all the ancient neighbors distinctly
recall early evidences of his predilection. His first
impulse towards the studies in which he won renown
came from George Ticknor. To help Prescott
pass away his time Ticknor read to his friend
the lectures he had been giving to advanced classes
at Harvard, lectures which formed the basis of his
<i>History of Spanish Literature</i>. This was in 1824.
Prescott became enthusiastic over the study of the
Spanish language and history. A year later he was
thinking what brilliant passages might be written
on the Inquisition, the Conquest of Granada, and
the exploits of the Great Captain. After balancing
Italian and Spanish subjects against each other,
he decided, not without misgivings, on a history
of Ferdinand and Isabella, and early in 1826
wrote to Alexander H. Everett, United States
minister at Madrid, asking his help in collecting
materials.</p>

<p>Three and a half years of study preceded the
writing of the first chapter; ten and a half years
in all were required to make the book. Its enthusiastic
reception from scholars and public alike
led Prescott to take up cognate subjects. The list
of his writings is brief, but, taking into account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
the difficulties involved, one may say without exaggeration
that Prescott’s historical works represent
a labor little short of titanic.</p>

<p>The <i>History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella
the Catholic</i> appeared in 1837. It was followed
by <i>The Conquest of Mexico</i>, 1843; <i>Critical
and Historical Essays</i>, 1845 (consisting chiefly of
papers reprinted from the ‘North American Review’);
<i>The Conquest of Peru</i>, 1847; <i>The History
of Philip the Second</i>, 1855 (left unfinished at the
author’s death). To this list of important works
may be added a brief continuation of Robertson’s
<i>Charles the Fifth</i>, and a <i>Memoir of Abbott Lawrence</i>.</p>

<p>Prescott’s life was without marked external incident.
His surroundings were ideal. Having inherited
a fortune, he could give himself to toilsome
literary undertakings with no care for the financial
result. He took satisfaction in the thought of
having refuted Johnson’s dictum that no man could
write history unless he had good eyes.</p>

<p>Early in 1858 Prescott was stricken with apoplexy,
but so far recovered as to be able to resume
work on the <i>History of Philip the Second</i>. A second
attack (January 27, 1859) ended in his death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_26">II<br />

<span class="subhead">PRESCOTT’S CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">To</span> those who knew him in varying degrees of
intimacy, whether as friends, neighbors, or chance
acquaintance, Prescott seemed the incarnation of
urbanity, thoughtfulness, good humor. To us who
know him only through the story of his life he
seems notable for his heroic qualities.</p>

<p>He had enormous courage and force of will.
That other men have performed great tasks under
like difficulties cannot lessen the glory of his individual
achievement. Handicapped by partial
blindness, he wrote history, a type of literature
which makes the most exacting demands on the
physical powers.</p>

<p>Had Prescott’s genius inclined him towards
poetry or fiction, the heroic element in his literary
life would have been less noteworthy. In general
a novelist is not expected to read; what is chiefly
required of him in the way of preparation is, that
he shall observe, feel, and occasionally think—but
not read; much reading makes a dull story-teller.
The novelist gleans material as he walks
the street. For his purpose an hour of talk with
‘a set of wretched un-idea’d girls,’ as Doctor Johnson
half affectionately, half pettishly, called them,
is worth ten hours over a book. History is another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
matter. The historian must often read a
thousand pages in order to write one. And the
work of preparation is indescribably exhausting;
there is so much detail to set in order, so many
documents to be consulted, such a wilderness of
notes to be arranged, compared, and fitted into
place. The task, difficult under the best conditions,
must seem endless to any one with an imperfect
sense.</p>

<p>A man with good eye-sight is like a man with
the free use of his legs, he goes where he pleases.
But a scholar with defective vision is an invalid
in a wheeled chair. Prescott, being denied one of
the greatest conveniences of study, was forced to
try expedients. With most writers pen and ink
are an indispensable aid to composition. Prescott
used memory instead. Not only was the knowledge
accumulated, arranged, and weighed, but it
was put into literary form, the paragraphs measured
and the sentences polished before the actual
writing was begun. Prescott often carried in his
head, for days at a time, the equivalent of sixty
pages of printed text, and on occasion, seventy-five
pages. Only by reflecting on the difficulties met and
overcome can the amateur of literature arrive at a
conception of Prescott’s indomitable courage.</p>

<p>Add to force and persistency of purpose another
notable trait, a passion for nobility of character.
Prescott, unwearied in self-examination, studied
his own moral nature as he studied the pages of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
his manuscript, that he might weed out the faults.
The methods he employed to this end were often
whimsical, and even childlike; but in their touching
simplicity lies the best proof of the genuineness
of the motive that prompted them.</p>

<h3 id="sec_27">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WRITER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Prescott</span> gave unusual measure of time and
thought to the problem of expression. With a
view to grounding himself in the technical part
of literature, he invoked the aid of those now forgotten
worthies, Lindley Murray and Hugh Blair—how
greatly to his advantage would be difficult
to say. Books of this sort are so often disfigured
by a vicious or, what is worse, a commonplace
style that it is a question whether one does not
lose by example all that he gains by precept.</p>

<p>Escaping these influences, Prescott took up the
chief English authors, beginning with Ascham,
Sidney, Bacon, Browne, Raleigh, and Milton.
His mind was constantly on the alert to discover
by what means these masters produced their effects.
His journals show how painstaking he was
in these studies, with what intense interest he
turned the problem of the art of expression over
and over in his mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p>When he came to print, it was observed first
of all that he had a ‘style.’ The self-conscious
literary workman was plainly visible. Prescott
had evidently aimed to produce certain effects
through the balance of his periods, the choice of
his words, the length and structure of his sentences.
Every one said: ‘He is an artist.’ Praise
could not have been more aptly bestowed. Among
many eminent artists in words Prescott was one of
the most conscientious.</p>

<p>But the literary style of the <i>Ferdinand and Isabella</i>
had the defect of being too apparent. One
often found himself taking note of the manner of
expression before he took note of the thought.
The panoply of words glittered from afar. It was
brilliant but metallic, magnificent but artificial.</p>

<p>The criticism of his first book taught Prescott
the futility of worrying about style—after one
has worried sufficiently. He was no less anxious
to improve; he noted the mannerisms into which
he had fallen, resolved to correct them, and that
was the conclusion of the whole matter. He
stopped dwelling overmuch on the fashion of his
writing, and at once gained in ease and naturalness.
After ten years of labor he had mastered
the materials of his art. His workmanship improved
to the last. The volumes of the <i>History
of Philip the Second</i> have literary characteristics so
gracious as to add sharpness to the regret that this
noble work had to be left unfinished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_28">IV<br />

<span class="subhead">THE HISTORIES</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> <i>Ferdinand and Isabella</i> is not a formidable
book for size. A timid reader, shrinking from
fifteen hundred pages of any literature but fiction,
need not fear mortgaging too much of his time in
the perusal. Compared with a reading of Freeman’s
<i>Norman Conquest</i> or Carlyle’s <i>Frederick</i>, his
task is light.</p>

<p>In an introductory section Prescott traces the
growth of Castile and Aragon, with their dependencies,
up to the time when Ferdinand and Isabella
come on the stage of history. Perhaps there
is a lack of detail here and there. One would like
to know the steps of the process by which the
Spaniards regained the territory from which they
had been driven by the Saracenic invasion of the
Eighth Century. Bitter as were the jealousies and
quarrels of the various petty states, they made
common cause against the Mohammedans. They
hated the hereditary enemy both as infidels and
usurpers. Hatred fostered the national spirit.</p>

<p>The history proper is divided into two parts.
The first has chiefly to do with the internal policy
of Ferdinand and Isabella. It was the period when
law displaced anarchy. The law might be severe
or even unjust, but it was at all events law. Here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
is shown how the power of the nobles was curbed,
warring factions pacified, banditti of all sorts kept
within bounds, and that too whether they lived
in castles or lurked in dark corners, heresy suppressed
in a truly rigorous fashion, above all the
national ideal strengthened. To use a homely
figure, Ferdinand and Isabella took up the problem
of national housekeeping and handled it as it
had never been handled before. A reign of order
and economy was inaugurated. Thieving servants
were put under restraint or discharged, poachers
were apprehended, and the gypsies who had impudently
camped on the best part of the estates
were driven off. A government which for years
had run at loose ends was now under masterful
control.</p>

<p>The second part illustrates the foreign policy
of the two monarchs. Having made a nation out
of an assemblage of turbulent states, Ferdinand
and Isabella were enabled to take a conspicuous
place among the sovereigns of Europe. By good
fortune in war and in discovery, by diplomatic
shrewdness and religious zeal, their influence was
felt throughout Europe and over the seas. Spain
was no longer isolated. Her name carried weight;
her will was respected.</p>

<p>Much of the narrative proceeds by divisions
each of which might have been printed as a monograph.
A certain amount of space is given to the
Inquisition, so much to the war in Granada, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
many chapters to the history of Columbus, so
many to the colonial policy, to the Italian wars, to
the life of Gonsalvo of Cordova, to the career of
Cardinal Ximenes.</p>

<p>While in no sense neglecting the constitutional
side of the problems before him, the historian’s
bent is to the biographical and pictorial phases of
the reign. On these he dwells with satisfaction and
often in detail. To him history is a pageant. The
rich coloring of the period first attracted Prescott;
he can hardly be blamed for painting his canvas
in lively hues, for so he conceived the design.
Neutral tints and dull tones are wholly wanting.
The blackness of certain events only serves to bring
out in stronger relief the resplendent brightness
of virtuous acts and the goodness of noble characters.
Torquemada offsets Isabella; the cruelty
of war is forgotten in the splendor of chivalric
deeds.</p>

<p>It is not a history of the people of Spain. The
people are not forgotten; the struggle of the commons
for recognition, for justice, for the right to
be themselves and express their individuality—these
things are taken into account. But the work
belongs rather to that older school of history which
concerns itself for the most part with wars and
royal progresses, with the intrigues of councillors,
the machinations of prelates, the rivalries of great
houses and powerful orders.</p>

<p>The <i>History of the Conquest of Mexico</i> is of about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
the same length as its predecessor. The narrative,
simpler in some ways and more vivacious in others,
is gorgeously colored throughout. Prescott was
disturbed by the picturesqueness of his own treatment.
‘Very like Miss Porter’ and ‘Rather
boarding schoolish finery’ were his comments on
certain chapters.</p>

<p>The first of the seven ‘books’ into which the
work is divided contains an account of Aztec
civilization. Sixty years have elapsed since these
pages were written, during which time American
archæology has made great advances. That the
value of Prescott’s introduction is not wholly destroyed
is due to the healthy sceptical spirit which
controlled his work.</p>

<p>The story has every element of romance. A
young Spanish gentleman, handsome, witty, daring,
an idler in college and a libertine, joins the
army of adventurers in the New World. For ten
or fifteen years he leads the life of men of his
class. He becomes a planter in Hayti and varies
the monotony of watching Indians till the soil by
suppressing insurrections of their brother Indians.</p>

<p>He goes to Cuba as secretary to the governor
of that island, quarrels with his chief, makes his
peace, and quarrels with him again. Thrown repeatedly
into prison, he escapes with the ease of a
Baron Trenck. Reconciled to the governor, he is
appointed to lead an expedition into the newly
discovered kingdom of Mexico. On this venture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
he stakes his every penny. With five hundred
soldiers he proposes to subdue the natives; two
priests go along to convert the natives as fast
as they are subdued. His sailors number one
hundred and ten; his pilot had served under
Columbus.</p>

<p>Arriving on the coast, he secretly scuttles his
ships, all but one, that there may be no retreat,
and then begins that wonderful march to the great
city of the Aztecs. He fights by craft as well as
by physical force. The jealousy of mutually hostile
tribes helps to win his battles. Superstition
comes to his aid, for the Spaniards are thought to
be gods, and the horses they bestride carry terror
into the hearts of the natives.</p>

<p>At length he makes his entry into the city of
flowers, and takes up his abode there, Cortés and
his little army of four hundred and fifty Spaniards,
with twice as many native allies, among sixty
thousand cannibals. Boldness marks every step
of his course. He seizes the native ‘king,’ suppresses
plots with rigor, and proves his divinity
by tearing down one of the sacrificial pyramids and
planting the cross in its stead. Leaving a lieutenant
in command, he hastens back to the seashore
to transact military business there. The lieutenant
precipitates a quarrel and slaughters Indians
by the hundred. Cortés returns and finds his work
must be done again. This time it is thoroughly
done. Every step of his progress is marked with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
blood, and the story of <i>la noche triste</i> and the
siege of Mexico are among the most romantic
passages in the history of the New World.</p>

<p>In estimating men Prescott aimed to employ
the standard of their day. When Cortés lifts up
his hands, red with the blood of the miserable
natives, to return thanks to Heaven for victory,
the historian does not permit himself to forget
that this savage Spaniard was a typical soldier of
the Cross. ‘Whoever has read the correspondence
of Cortés, or, still more, has attended to
the circumstances of his career, will hardly doubt
that he would have been among the first to lay
down his life for the Faith.’ According to Prescott,
the charge of cruelty cannot be brought
against Cortés. ‘The path of the conqueror is
necessarily marked with blood. He was not too
scrupulous, indeed, in the execution of his plans.
He swept away the obstacles which lay in his
track; and his fame is darkened by the commission
of more than one act which his boldest
apologists will find it hard to vindicate. But he
was not wantonly cruel. He allowed no outrage
on his unresisting foes.’ The historian likens the
Spaniard to Hannibal in his endurance, his courage,
and his unpretentiousness.</p>

<p>Later scholarship has assailed portions of <i>The
Conquest of Mexico</i> with needless asperity. Prescott
could hardly be expected to avail himself prophetically
of archæological facts not known until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
thirty years after his time. Nor was his faith in
the early Spanish accounts of the Conquest quite
as childlike and uncritical as it is sometimes represented.
Historians are the most substantial of
men of letters; but they now and then build card
houses which topple down under the breath of a
single new fact. And they take a very human delight
in blowing over one another’s structures.
For which reason the reading of history is a fearful
joy, like skating on thin ice. The pleasure is
intense so long as nothing gives way. Perhaps
the layman is unreasonable in his demand for
knowledge that shall not require too frequent revision.
He can at least read for pleasure, hoping
that a part of what he reads is true, and holding
himself prepared to relinquish the parts he likes
best when the time comes.</p>

<p>In the <i>History of the Conquest of Peru</i> the author
brings fresh proof that whatever may be said
of his morals, the Spanish soldier cannot be over-praised
for his valor. Pizarro was a marvel of
courage and endurance. Fanaticism, which explains
much in his character, does not explain where such
tremendous physical power came from. And he
had the true theatrical bravado of the Sixteenth-century
adventurer. Add to the native histrionic
gifts of the Latin race a special training, such as
life in the New World gave, and men like Ojeda,
Balboa, Cortés, and Pizarro come into existence
quite naturally. They did wonders in the coolest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
possible way, and with a fine sense of the pictorial
aspect of their undertakings. Pizarro, drawing a
line from east to west on the sand with his sword
and calling on his comrades to choose each man
what best becomes a brave Castilian (‘For my part
I go to the south’), is a figure for romantic drama.
An Englishman equally daring would have been
more or less awkward in a pose of this sort, but
the Spaniard was perfectly at home. Of what
clay were these men compounded that they could
imagine such exploits and succeed in them too?</p>

<p>The performance of Pizarro was less splendid
than that of Cortés and the man himself less interesting.
The conqueror of Mexico was a gentleman;
not so the hard soldier who subdued the
kingdom of the Incas. His was a violent career,
steeped in blood, and ending in assassination. Not
only was Pizarro without fear, but of two courses
he seized upon the more dangerous as the better
suited to his genius. Too ignorant to sign his own
name, he could control not alone the brutal soldier
but as well the lawyer and the priest. Aside from
his masterfulness there was little to admire in his
character. Brute force excites wonder, but the
exhibition of it becomes wearisome at last. To
Prescott ‘the hazard assumed by Pizarro was far
greater than that of the Conqueror of Mexico.’
Otherwise the man was a mere bungler upon whom
Fortune, with characteristic levity, chanced for a
time to smile. Prescott describes him in a sentence:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
‘Pizarro was eminently perfidious.’ Furthermore,
the conqueror of Peru was not original; he repeated
what he had learned from Balboa and
Cortés. Had he chanced upon a country less rich
and civilized, it may well be doubted whether
he would have made any considerable figure in
history. The argument from gold was entirely
conclusive in those days; just as at the present
time an undertaking is said to ‘succeed’ if it pays
financially. Manners have improved, but ideals of
‘success’ are pretty much what they were four
hundred years ago. When Pizarro extorted from
the wretched Atahualpa a promise to fill a room
twenty-two feet by seventeen to the height of nine
feet with gold, his place in history was assured.
The swineherd had become immortal.</p>

<p>Strange is it that the name of Francisco Pizarro
should be a household word while that of his
brother Gonzalo is but little known and seldom
repeated. Yet there are few episodes in the history
of Spanish colonization more striking than the
story of Gonzalo Pizarro’s march across the Andes
and the discovery of the river Amazon. It is a
tale of horror and suffering to which only the pen
of a Defoe could do justice. Gonzalo not only
survived the fearful journey, but had strength
enough left to head a party for revolt against the
viceroy, Blasco Nuñez, and the execution of the
Ordinances. Like a true Pizarro, this conqueror
died a violent death. He was beheaded; it seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
the only fitting way for one of that family to take
his departure from life. The Pizarros used to behead
their victims and then show themselves conspicuously
at the funeral. When it came their turn
to die, they were treated with scantier courtesy.</p>

<p><i>Philip the Second</i> was Prescott’s most ambitious
work. Though but a fragment, the fragment is of
noble dimensions, being longer by many pages
than the <i>Ferdinand and Isabella</i>. The narrative is
extraordinarily vivid. Few pages can match for
interest those in which are described Philip’s coming
to Flanders and his assumption of power at
the hands of his father Charles the Fifth. Here
are exhibited at their best the much-praised qualities
of Prescott’s style. His prose grew better as
he grew older.</p>

<p>The characters stand out like the figures of a
play: the great princes, Charles the Fifth, Philip,
Mary of England, and Elizabeth; the great warriors
and statesmen, Guise, Montmorency, Alva,
Egmont, and William of Orange; noble ladies
like Margaret of Parma and the beautiful Elizabeth
of France. The events were of high and
tragic importance, for during this reign was to be
settled the great question of freedom of thought
and the right to worship God as the conscience
and the reason dictated. The very contrasts of
costume came to the aid of the historian in dealing
with this romantic age. It would seem as if
the writer must be picturesque in spite of himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>The modern reader, whatever be his natural
bent, finds himself impelled by the critical spirit
of the times into distrusting all history which is
not technical and hard to grasp. Prescott’s books
are incorrigibly ‘literary’ and therefore more or
less under suspicion. Because they are attractive,
it is taken for granted that they are unsound.
Certain unhappy beings have gone so far as to
slander them outright by calling them romances.
But this is mere impatience with the kind of historical
writing which Prescott’s work exemplifies.
He was a master of the art of narrative; and history
which stops with narrative is in the minds of
severe students little better than the more vicious
forms of literary idleness, such as poetry and fiction.
Prescott gratifies his reader’s curiosity about
the past, but is not over solicitous to ‘modify his
view of the present and his forecast of the future.’
In other words, he is well content to look
at the surface of history, leaving it to others to
look below the surface and philosophize on what
they find there.</p>

<p>Nevertheless these brilliant volumes have a
value which is something more than literary even
if it be a good deal less than scientific. It is
perhaps not extravagant to pronounce them an indispensable
propædeutic to the study of Spanish-American
history. They cannot be displaced by
works which ‘go much deeper into the subject.’
Depth is not what is at all times most needed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
We need stimulus, and encouragement to face
the discipline awaiting us in deep books. He who,
having read Prescott, was content to read no farther
would be an odd sort of student; but not so
odd as he who labored under the impression that
Prescott was a historian whom he could afford to
do without.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> clerical profession was in a manner hereditary
in the Emerson race. With a single
exception there was a minister in each of six generations
descending from Thomas Emerson of
Ipswich, Massachusetts. For this one lapse compensation
was made; another generation furnished
the colony with three ministers.</p>

<p>For nearly a century and a half the history of the
family has centred in Concord, Massachusetts. The
house known as the ‘Old Manse’ was built in 1765
by William Emerson, the young minister of the
First Church. Gentle in spirit, he was an ardent
patriot and in Revolutionary times won the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
of the ‘fighting parson.’ He came honestly by his
militant temper, being a grandson of the famous Father
Moody who distinguished himself at the siege
of Louisburg as a preacher, fighter, and iconoclast.</p>

<p>Besides the gift of eloquence, William Emerson
inherited from his father (the Reverend Joseph
Emerson of Maiden) a love of literature. This
he apparently bequeathed to his son, William,
who in turn transmitted it to his son, the author
of <i>Conduct of Life</i> and <i>Representative Men</i>.</p>

<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson was born in Boston on
May 25, 1803. His father, minister of the First
Church of that city, was a man of vigorous intellect,
fond of society, and, judging from one of his
letters, endowed with a caustic wit. His mother,
Ruth (Haskins) Emerson, was distinguished for
her high-bred manners and tender thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>Severity on the part of parents was thought good
for boys in that day. Ralph never forgot how his
father ‘twice or thrice put me in mortal terror
by forcing me into the salt water, off some wharf
or bathing-house; and I still recall the fright with
which, after some of these salt experiences, I
heard his voice one day (as Adam that of the
Lord God in the garden) summoning me to a new
bath, and I vainly endeavoring to hide myself.’</p>

<p>Left a widow in 1811, with five boys to educate,
Mrs. Emerson was forced to heroic exertions.
Her sacrifices made a deep impress on the mind
of the most famous of those boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>From the Boston Latin School, Emerson went
to Harvard College and was graduated in 1821
‘with ambitions to be a professor of rhetoric and
elocution.’ After a period of school-teaching, a
profession towards which his attitude was unequivocal
(‘Better saw wood, better sow hemp, better
hang with it after it is sown, than sow the seeds
of instruction’), he began his theological studies
at Harvard and in due time was ‘approbated to
preach.’ Ill health drove him South for a winter
(1826–27), where he saw novel sights, and made
the acquaintance of Achille Murat, son of the
quondam King of Naples. Emerson had Murat
for a fellow traveller from St. Augustine to Charleston:
‘I blessed my stars for my fine companion,
and we talked incessantly.’</p>

<p>On March 11, 1829, Emerson was ordained as
colleague of Henry Ware in the Second Church
of Boston and a little later ‘became the sole incumbent.’
He resigned this advantageous post of
labor (September, 1832) because of doubts about
the rite of the Lord’s Supper and the offering
of public prayer. To many observers his career
seemed wilfully spoiled by himself.</p>

<p>With impaired health and in despondency and
grief (he had but recently lost his young wife)<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
Emerson tried the effect of a year abroad. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
sailed from Boston and arrived at Malta on February
2, 1833. Thence he proceeded to Syracuse,
Taormina, Messina, Palermo, and Naples. After
visiting the other chief cities of Italy, he journeyed
to Paris, which he admired none the less because
he felt out of place there; ‘Pray what brought you
here, grave Sir?’ the moving Boulevard seemed to
say. But he had the opportunity of hearing Jouffroy
at the Sorbonne, and of paying his respects to Lafayette.
In London he saw Coleridge. At Edinburgh
he learned Carlyle’s whereabouts, visited
him, and found him, ‘good and wise and pleasant.’
He was unfortunate in his trip to the Highlands
(‘the scenery of a shower-bath must be always much
the same’). He called on Wordsworth at Rydal
Mount. In early October he was back at home.</p>

<p>The future was uncertain. Emerson was reluctant
to give up the ministry, and preached from
time to time as the chance presented itself. For
some weeks he supplied Orville Dewey’s church
in New Bedford, but when it was intimated that
on Dewey’s resignation he might be invited to
succeed him, Emerson made the impossible conditions
that he should neither administer the Communion,
nor offer prayer ‘unless he felt moved to
do so.’ He supplied the pulpit of the Unitarian
church in Concord during three months of the
pastor’s illness and for three years preached to
the little congregation in East Lexington.</p>

<p>Having cut himself off from the only ‘regular’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
mode of life that seemed open to him, Emerson
took up the irregular vocation of lecturer. During
the winter following his return from Europe, he
had lectured before the Boston Society of Natural
History. Beginning in January, 1835, he gave a
course on ‘Biography’ consisting of six lectures:
‘Tests of Great Men,’ ‘Michelangelo,’ ‘Luther,’
‘Milton,’ ‘Fox,’ and ‘Burke.’ During succeeding
winters he gave ten lectures on ‘English Literature’
(1835–36), twelve lectures on ‘The Philosophy
of History’ (1836–37), ten lectures on
‘Human Culture’ (1837–38), ten lectures on ‘Human
Life’ (1838–39), ten lectures on ‘The Present
Age’ (1839–40). He was now fairly engaged in
his new calling.</p>

<p>Meantime he had fixed on Concord for his permanent
home, bought a house there, married Miss
Lydia Jackson of Plymouth, and begun that career
of which one of his biographers has humorously
complained, ‘a life devoid of incident, of nearly
untroubled happiness, and of absolute conformity
to the moral law.’</p>

<p>In 1836 there was published anonymously a
little volume entitled <i>Nature</i>. It was Emerson’s
first book. His influence as a man of letters begins
at this point. The succeeding volumes consisted
in part of lectures which, having stood the
test of public delivery, were now recast in essay
form. Not every essay, however, had its first
presentation as spoken discourse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>On formal public occasions Emerson was often
invited to give the address. There was authority
in his utterances. That he was not unlikely to
say something revolutionary seemed to make it
the more important that he should be heard often.
He gave the Historical Address at Concord at the
Second Centennial Anniversary, the Phi Beta
Kappa Oration at Harvard on ‘The American
Scholar’ (August, 1837), and the Address before
the Senior Class in Divinity College (July 15,
1838), which brought down on him the wrath of
Andrews Norton and a shower of remonstrances
from Unitarian ministers who, however, loved him
too much to be angry with him.</p>

<p>At the time of the Divinity Hall Address the
so-called Transcendental movement was in full
progress. The movement grew in part out of informal
meetings held by a group of liberal thinkers
with a view to protesting against the unsatisfactory
state of current opinion in theology and philosophy,
and looking for something broader and
deeper.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>Transcendentalism was an intellectual ferment.
Having a philosophical and religious significance,
it was also notable for its effect on social, educational,
and literary matters. Emerson defined
it as faith in intuitions. It has been called an
‘outburst of Romanticism on Puritan ground.’
Certain historians connect it with German transcendental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
philosophy. That it was indigenous to
New England appears to be the sounder view.
According to a high authority,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> ‘Emerson’s transcendentalism
was native to his mind.... It
had been in the life and thought of his family for
generations.’ He was certainly regarded as the
heresiarch.</p>

<p>Like most complex movements Transcendentalism
had a grotesque side. The enthusiasts, in
their anxiety to be emancipated from old formulas,
fell victims to ‘the vice of the age,—the propensity
to exaggerate the importance of visible
and tangible facts.’ Emerson laughs at them a
little: ‘They promise the establishment of the
kingdom of heaven and end with champing unleavened
bread or dedicating themselves to the
nourishment of a beard.’</p>

<p>The movement had an ‘organ,’ a quarterly
magazine called ‘The Dial,’ the first number of
which appeared in July, 1840. George Ripley was
the business manager, Margaret Fuller the editor.
It came under Emerson’s care two years later, and
in 1844 was abandoned. An audience large enough
to support the organ could not be found.</p>

<p>Transcendentalism coincided chronologically
with several plans for bettering the condition of
the world. ‘We are a little wild here with numberless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
projects of social reform. Not a reading
man but has his draft of a new community in his
waistcoat pocket. I am gently mad myself.’<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>Emerson was sympathetic with the community
experiments at ‘Brook Farm’ and ‘Fruitlands,’
but not to the extent of joining them. He approved
every wild action of the experimenters,
nevertheless he had a work of his own.</p>

<p>The work consisted in bringing his thought to
his public by means of lectures. He was not
overfond of the medium of communication. ‘Are
not lectures a kind of Peter Parley’s story of
Uncle Plato, and a puppet show of the Eleusinian
mysteries?’ he asks. It is not recorded what
he thought of that kind of lecturing which may
best be described in Byron’s phrase—‘to giggle
and make giggle.’ He frankly (but unenviously)
admired the speaker who could produce instantaneous
effects, moving the audience to laughter or
tears. His own gifts were of another sort. When
‘the stout Illinoisian’ after a short trial walked out
of the hall Emerson’s sympathies were with him:
‘Shakespeare, or Franklin, or Esop, coming to
Illinois, would say, I must give my wisdom a
comic form,...’</p>

<p>Urged thereto by his generous friend Alexander
Ireland of the Manchester ‘Examiner,’ who took
on himself all the business responsibilities, Emerson
(in 1847) made a lecturing trip to England.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
He spoke in Manchester, Edinburgh, London,
and elsewhere. The lectures were ‘attacked by the
clergymen,’ and the attacks met with ‘pale though
brave defences’ by Emerson’s friends. After a
few weeks in Paris, then in the throes of the revolution,
the lecturer returned by way of England to
America.</p>

<p>The crisis in the anti-slavery conflict was approaching.
Emerson, in spite of his philosophical
attitude towards reformers, became more and more
identified with the Abolitionists. During a political
speech at Cambridge he was repeatedly hissed
by students. According to an eye-witness, he
‘seemed absolutely to enjoy it.’ As late as 1861
he was received with marked hostility by the audience
which gathered at the annual meeting of the
Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. ‘The Mob
roared whenever I attempted to speak, and after
several beginnings I withdrew.’ The breaking out
of the war in a way relieved him. Now people
knew where they stood.</p>

<p>His chief source of income was cut off for a
time. The public was not in the mood for lectures
such as his. Later he found it possible to
resume his courses, and he continued to lecture
effectively until within a few years of his death.</p>

<p>Emerson’s principal books are: <i>Nature</i>, 1836;
<i>Essays</i>, 1841; <i>Essays</i>, ‘second series,’ 1844; <i>Poems</i>,
1847; <i>Miscellanies</i>, 1849 (lectures and addresses,
together with a reprint of <i>Nature</i>); <i>Representative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
Men</i>, 1850; <i>English Traits</i>, 1856; <i>Conduct of Life</i>,
1860; <i>May-Day and Other Pieces</i>, 1867; <i>Society
and Solitude</i>, 1870; <i>Letters and Social Aims</i>, 1876;
<i>Lectures and Biographical Sketches</i>, 1884; and
<i>Natural History of Intellect</i>, 1893. He edited a
number of Carlyle’s books, contributed several
chapters to the <i>Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli</i>
and compiled a poetic anthology, <i>Parnassus</i>, 1875.
<i>The Correspondence of Thomas Carlyle and Ralph
Waldo Emerson</i> (edited by C. E. Norton), 1883,
contains two hundred of Emerson’s letters.</p>

<p>In 1863 Emerson was one of the ‘visitors’ to
the Military Academy at West Point. In 1866
he was Phi Beta Kappa orator at Harvard, and
the following year received from his college the
degree of LL. D.</p>

<p>From 1867 to 1879 he was an overseer of
Harvard. In 1870, before a little audience of
students from the advanced classes, he gave a
course on the ‘Natural History of Intellect,’ the
subject in the handling of which he had hoped
to write his master work. One of the surprises
of his later life was his nomination for the office
of Lord Rector of Glasgow University by the independent
party (1874). There were two other
candidates. Emerson polled five hundred votes.
Disraeli was victor with seven hundred votes.</p>

<p>Emerson’s memory failed gradually, but the
defect was not much noticed until after the shock
consequent on the burning of his house (1872).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
A trip to Egypt did much to restore his health
and he never lost the ‘royal trait of cheerfulness.’
He died, after a brief illness, on April 27, 1882.</p>

<h3 id="sec_30">II<br />

<span class="subhead">EMERSON’S CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> praise which Emerson gives to character at
the expense of luxurious surroundings was sincere.
His own tastes were very simple. ‘Can anything
be so elegant as to have few wants and to serve
them one’s self, so as to have something left to
give, instead of being always prompt to grab?’
Acknowledging himself enmeshed in the conventionalities
of ‘civilized’ life and no more responsible
than his fellow victims, he nevertheless did
what he could to follow out his theory. He would
at least not be one of the infirm people of society,
who, if they miss any one of their comforts, ‘represent
themselves as the most wronged and most
wretched persons on earth.’ Emerson did not
live in the woods on twenty-seven cents a week,
but he had no objection to a friend’s living that
way if the friend found it profitable. For himself
he would not be ‘absurd and pedantic in reform.’</p>

<p>No characteristic is more marked than his
spirit of tolerance. It was not of a smooth, purring
sort, growing out of eagerness to please or unwillingness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
to offend, but rather an aggressive tolerance.
Emerson would not merely grant to every
man ‘the allowance he takes,’ but would even force
him to take it. He was patient with the most
obnoxious of reformers. And he could be tolerant
with those who could tolerate nothing.</p>

<p>With pronounced and original views he had
little solicitude to impose his views on others. He
was without egotism. To state the truth as he
apprehended it and to let the world come to his
ideas if the world could and would, contented him.
But he had no quarrel with the order of things.
His good humor and smiling patience are manifest
in everything he has written.</p>

<p>Emerson held firmly to the doctrine of the
brotherhood of man, yet with no touch of the
unctuous fraternizer. He had the rebuffs that all
must encounter who try to break down the partition
wall between classes. In an attempt to solve,
according to the Golden Rule, the problem of a
servant’s status in the household, he was thoroughly
beaten and laughingly acknowledged it. He did
his share, but the servant refused to fraternize.</p>

<p>He was a good citizen, an excellent neighbor,
prompt in the acknowledgment of all homely
duties. His was a large-souled, benignant, and
gracious nature. There was something healing in
his mere presence, though no word was spoken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_31">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WRITER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Emerson</span> gave sound advice on the art of writing,
like a professor of rhetoric. He commended the
sentences that would stand the test of the voice.
This is applying physiology to literature. He
laughed at the habit of exaggeration, though he
also said, ‘The superlative is as good as the
positive if it be alive.’ His rules are excellent,
and if followed must give distinction to whatever
page of writing they are applied. But while they
go no deeper than other suggestions, they point
out the obvious characteristics of his style.</p>

<p>For example, Emerson thought clarity all-important.
He aimed at it, and attained it. He
believed in the use of the right word, and was dissatisfied
unless it could be found. The right word
is always illuminating, and as a result Emerson’s
English is full of surprises. Even when the term
employed shocks by its unexpectedness, we presently
feel that after all the choice was not grotesque.
In practice Emerson was no spendthrift
of words, that currency which loses weight and
value in the ratio of one’s prodigality, but delighted
in economy. No doubt his style is aphoristic—that
is a natural result of writing aphorisms. But
if no less aphoristic, it is far more logical than is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
commonly reported. The want of sequence in
Emerson’s work has been exaggerated, often to
the point of absurdity.</p>

<p>There are writers who have two distinct literary
styles, as they have two faces, one to be photographed
in, and one for natural wear. Emerson
had one style, which was dual-toned, each tone
taking the color of his prevailing thought, and
each shading imperceptibly into the other. A
dozen pages picked at random from his best essays
will hardly fail to show how sublimated his
diction could be at times. Then does it come
near to the line dividing poetry from prose, from
which it presently falls away to the level of everyday
need. Poetic as Emerson’s diction frequently
is, it is always controlled. On the other hand, when
it sinks to plain prose it never loses the air of distinction
and breeding.</p>

<h3 id="sec_32">IV<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>NATURE, ADDRESSES, AND LECTURES</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">In</span> the introduction of his first book, <i>Nature</i>,
Emerson announces his favorite doctrine, the
necessity of seeing the world through our own
eyes, of being original, not imitative. He then
proceeds with his interpretation. Nature not only
exalts man, giving him a pleasure so tonic that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
admonishes to temperance, but also renders him
certain services. They may be classified under
Commodity, Beauty, Language, and Discipline.
The first, albeit the lowest, is perfect in its kind;
men everywhere comprehend the ‘steady and
prodigal provision’ that has been made for their
comfort. Beauty is the second, and meets a nobler
want. ‘Nature satisfies by its loveliness,’ and
‘without any mixture of corporeal benefit.’ ‘Give
me health and a day, and I will make the pomp
of emperors ridiculous.’ This is not enough,
there must be a spiritual element. Such element
is found in the will and virtue of man. An act
of truth or heroism ‘seems at once to draw to
itself the sky as its temple.’ Beauty in Nature
also becomes an object of the intellect. It reforms
itself in the mind, leads to a new creation, and
hence Art.</p>

<p>Nature is the source of language, words being
the signs of natural facts. But ‘every natural fact
is a symbol of some spiritual fact.’ In brief, ‘the
world is emblematic.’ Nature is a discipline of
the understanding, devoting herself to forming the
common-sense. Nature is the discipline of the
will, after which she becomes the ally of Religion.
In short, so great is the part played by Nature in
disciplining man that the ‘noble doubt’ perpetually
arises ‘whether the end be not the Final Cause
of the Universe; and whether nature outwardly
exists.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>What then? It makes no difference ‘whether
Orion is up there in heaven or some god paints
the image in the firmament of the soul.’ Culture
has the uniform effect of leading us to regard nature
as a phenomenon, not a substance. Nature
herself gives us the hint of Idealism. The poet
teaches the same lesson. The philosopher seeking,
not Beauty, but Truth, dissolves the ‘solid seeming
block of matter’ by a thought. Intellectual
science begets ‘invariably a doubt of the existence
of matter.’ Ethics and religion have the same
effect of degrading ‘nature and suggesting its dependence
on spirit.’</p>

<p>Back of all nature, then, is spirit. ‘The world
proceeds from the same spirit as the body of man.
It is a remoter and inferior incarnation of God.’
At present man has not come into his whole kingdom.
He depends on his understanding alone. Let
him apply all his powers, the reason as well as the
understanding.</p>

<p>Brief as it is, this little book shows to perfection
the richness of Emerson’s thought, his skill in the
apothegm, his economy of phrase, the poetic cast
of his mind, and the beauty of his diction.</p>

<p>Nine addresses and lectures are printed along
with <i>Nature</i> in the definitive edition of Emerson’s
writings. The first is the Phi Beta Kappa Oration,
‘The American Scholar,’ in which Emerson
sounds with resonant tone that note of independence
so marked in all his teaching. It was time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
he thought, for the ‘sluggard intellect’ of America
to ‘look from under its iron lids’ and prove itself
equal to something more than ‘exertions of mechanical
skill.’ We have been too long the bond
slave of Europe.</p>

<p>True emancipation consists in freedom from the
idea that only a few gifted ones of the earth are
privileged to learn truth at first hand. Let us not
be cowed by great men.</p>

<p>Emerson notes three influences acting upon the
scholar. First, nature, always with us and taking
the impress of our minds. Second, books, which,
noble as they are in theory, have their danger: ‘I
had better never see a book than be warped by
its attraction clean out of my own orbit.’ Third,
life, everything which is the opposite of mere
thinking. ‘If it were only for a vocabulary the
scholar would be covetous of action. Life is our
dictionary.’</p>

<p>Above all, he praises the obscure scholar who
without hope of visible reward, reckoning at true
value the seesaw of public whim and fancy, patient
of neglect, patient of reproach, ‘is happy if he can
satisfy himself alone that this day he has seen
something truly.’</p>

<p>‘The Divinity Address,’ as it is called, was
thought in its day nothing short of outrageous radicalism.
The now well-known Emersonian plea for
a noble individuality is made in terms the most inspiring.
He bewails the helplessness of mankind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
‘All men go in flocks to this saint or that poet,
avoiding the God who seeth in secret.’ Emerson
would drive out the spirit which prompts a man
to content himself with being ‘an easy secondary
to some Christian scheme, or sectarian connection,
or some eminent man.’ He would have men follow
no one leader, however distinguished or gifted,
but seek truth at first hand, know God face to face.
And while he grants that nothing is of value in
comparison with the soul of a good and great man,
even a great man becomes a source of danger if
we propose to rest in the shadow of his achievement
rather than develop our own gift.</p>

<p>‘The Method of Nature’ is a rhapsody in
praise of the spontaneous and unreasoning as over
against the logical and definite. Nature looks to
great results, not to little ones, to the type rather
than the individual.</p>

<p>In ‘Man the Reformer’ Emerson preaches
another favorite doctrine, the necessity of manual
work. There is nothing fanciful in his view. He
did not set himself against division of labor. He did
not insist that every man should be a farmer ‘any
more than that every man should be a lexicographer.’
His ‘doctrine of the Farm’ is that
‘every man ought to stand in primary relations
with the work of the world.’</p>

<p>This address should be read in connection with
the one on ‘The Times,’ which supplements it.
The ideal reformer is not he who has some cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
at heart in comparison with which all other causes
are naught. The reformer is the ‘Re-maker of
what man has made; a renouncer of lies, a restorer
of truth and good, imitating that great
Nature which embosoms us all, and which sleeps
no moment on an old past.’</p>

<p>A reading of this address ought to be followed
by a reading of the one entitled ‘The Conservative.’
As he had advised reformers of the danger
to which they were exposed, he now warns conservatives
not to forget that they are the retrograde
party. By their theory of life sickness is a necessity
and the social frame a hospital. Yet in a
planet ‘peopled with conservatives one Reformer
may yet be born.’</p>

<p>In the lecture on ‘The Transcendentalist’
Emerson comes to a tempered defence of his own.
He defines the new movement; it is merely Idealism
as it shows itself in 1840—an old thing under
a new name. He is very patient with the Transcendentalists,
whose chief idiosyncrasy is that they
have ‘struck work.’ ‘Now every one must do after
his kind, be he asp or angel, and these must.’
American literature and spiritual history will profit
by the turmoil. This heresy will leave its mark,
as any one will admit who knows ‘these seething
brains, these admirable radicals, these talkers who
talk the sun and moon away.’</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>THE ESSAYS</i>, <i>REPRESENTATIVE MEN</i>,
<i>ENGLISH TRAITS</i>, <i>CONDUCT OF LIFE</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">When</span> the <i>Essays</i> appeared, Emerson found a
larger audience. He now spoke through the medium
of a recognized literary form. If all readers
do not read essays, they at least know what they
are and stand in no fear of them. Some buyers
may have been tempted by the table of contents.
Titles such as ‘Self-Reliance,’ ‘Compensation,’
‘Friendship,’ ‘Heroism,’ had an encouraging
sound and promised useful advice.</p>

<p>In the essay on ‘History,’ Emerson reaffirms
the doctrine of the unity of human nature. There
is ‘one mind,’ history is its record. What we
possess in common with the men of the past enables
us to comprehend and interpret the actions
of the men of the past. The facts must square
with our own experience.</p>

<p>The theme is continued in ‘Self-Reliance.’ As
there is one mind common to all men, and as what
belongs to greatness of the Past belongs also to
us, it is suicide to descend to imitation. ‘Speak
your latent conviction and it shall become the
universal sense.’ The whole essay is a glowing
exhortation to men to live largely and stand on
their own feet, facing the world with the nonchalance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
begotten of health, good humor, and the
sense of possession.</p>

<p>In ‘Compensation’ the essayist notes those
inexorable forces by which a balance is kept in the
world, the laws by virtue of which ‘things refuse
to be mismanaged long.’ In ‘Spiritual Laws’ he
shows the importance of living the life of nature.
Let no man import into his mind ‘difficulties
which are none of his.’ The essay on ‘Love’ is
a prose poem in honor of that passion which
‘makes the clown gentle, and gives the coward
heart.’ Following it is the essay on ‘Friendship’
with its austere definitions. ‘I do not wish to treat
friendships daintily, but with roughest courage.’
‘Friendship implies sincerity, and sincerity is the
luxury allowed, like diadems and authority, only
to the highest rank.’</p>

<p>Emerson writes on ‘Prudence’ in order to
balance those fine lyric words of Love and Friendship
with words of coarser sound. Prudence considered
in itself is naught; but recognized as one
of the conditions of existence, it deserves our utmost
attention. It keeps a man from standing in
false and bitter relations to other men. Emerson
had no patience with people who, because they
have genius or beauty, expect an exception of the
laws of Nature to be made in their case. Notwithstanding
their gifts, they must toe the mark.</p>

<p>‘Heroism,’ the eighth essay in this volume,
contains a definition of the hero which does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
coincide with the popular conception. We are so
accustomed to seeing our heroes crowned with
wreaths and overwhelmed with lecture engagements
the day following the act of valor that we are
surprised to read: ‘Heroism works in contradiction
to the voice of mankind.’ Emerson gives a
new turn to the old phrase ‘the heroic in everyday
life.’ Life, he says, has its ‘ragged and dangerous
front.’ It is full of evils against which the man
must be armed. ‘Let him hear in season that he
is born into a state of war.’ To this ‘militant
attitude of the soul’ Emerson gave the name of
heroism. In its rudest form it is ‘contempt for
safety and ease.’</p>

<p>To some readers the essay on ‘The Over-Soul’
is at once the clearest and the most darkened, the
plainest and the most enigmatic of the essays in
this book. But there is no misapprehending the
value of this effort to put, not in rigid scientific
terms, but in glowing and lofty imagery, the dependence
of man on the Infinite, the marvel of
that Immensity which is the background of our
being. ‘From within or from behind, a light
shines through us upon things, and makes us
aware that we are nothing, but the light is all.’
It is the universal mind by which all being is enveloped
and interpenetrated.</p>

<p>The essay on ‘Circles’ contains this thought:
Outside every circle another may be drawn.
Opinion seeks to crystallize at a certain limit, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
insist that there is nothing beyond. The soul
bursts these barriers to set new limits, which in turn
are good only for a time. Man must therefore
keep himself always open to the conception of a
larger circle. Let him ‘prefer truth to his past
apprehension of truth.’</p>

<p>How to seek truth is the subject of the next
essay, ‘Intellect,’ a tribute to the spontaneous
action of the mind. We do not control our
thoughts but are controlled by them. All we can
do is to clear away obstructions and ‘suffer the
intellect to see.’ Pursue truth and it avoids you.
Relax the energy of your pursuit and it comes to
you; yet the pursuit was as necessary as the subsequent
relaxation.</p>

<p>In the final essay, on ‘Art,’ the large, simple,
and homely elements are praised, the qualities
which appeal to universal human nature. In the
paintings of the Old World one thinks to be astonished
by something new and strange, and he
is struck by the familiar look. He is reminded of
what he had always known.</p>

<p>The second series of <i>Essays</i> treats of ‘The
Poet,’ ‘Experience,’ ‘Character,’ ‘Manners,’
‘Gifts,’ ‘Nature,’ ‘Politics,’ of ‘Nominalist and
Realist;’ there is also a lecture on ‘New England
Reformers.’ Emerson notes the shallow nature
of a theory of poetry busied only with externals.
Neither is that poetry which is written ‘at a safe
distance from our own experience.’ The poet is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
representative. ‘He stands among common men
for the complete man, and apprises us not of his
wealth but of the commonwealth.’</p>

<p>‘Experience’ is in praise of a mode of life which
consists in living without making a fuss about it,
filling the time, taking hold where one can and
exhausting the possibilities. Only fanatics say it
is not worth while. ‘Let us be poised, and wise,
and our own, to-day. Let us treat the men and
women well; treat them as if they were real; perhaps
they are.’</p>

<p>‘Character’ and ‘Manners’ are related studies.
There is a moral order in the world. Nothing can
withstand it. ‘Character is this moral order seen
through the medium of an individual nature.’
Society has raised certain artificial distinctions.
But they must be recognized. Society is real, and
grows out of a genuine need. ‘The painted phantasm
Fashion casts a species of derision on what
we say. But I will neither be driven from some
allowance to Fashion as a symbolic institution,
nor from the belief that love is the basis of
courtesy.’</p>

<p>‘Gifts’ is a fine bit of paradox. ‘The gift, to
be true, must be the flowing of the giver unto
me, correspondent to my flowing unto him.
When the waters are at level, then my goods pass
to him, and his to me.’ To give useful things
denies the relation. Hence the fitness of beautiful
things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>There is bold imagery in the essay on ‘Nature.’
‘Plants are the young of the world, but they
grope ever upward toward consciousness; the
trees are imperfect men, and seem to bemoan
their imprisonment, rooted to the ground. The
animal is the novice and probationer of a more
advanced order. The men though young, having
tasted the first drop from the cup of thought,
are already dissipated: the maples and ferns are
still uncorrupt; yet no doubt when they come
to consciousness they too will curse and swear.’
Thus does Emerson describe that glimpse he had
of a ‘system in transition.’</p>

<p>A healthy optimism pervades the essay on ‘Politics.’
In spite of meddling and selfishness the
foundations of the State are very secure. ‘Things
have their laws, as well as men; and things refuse
to be trifled with.’ By a higher law property
will be protected. The same necessity secures to
each nation the form of governing best suited to
it. Yet all forms are defective. Good men ‘must
not obey the laws too well.’ Perfect government
rests on character at last. There are dreamers who
do not despair of seeing the State renovated ‘on
the principle of right and love.’</p>

<p><i>Representative Men</i> consists of lectures on Plato,
Swedenborg, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Napoleon,
and Goethe, together with an introduction on the
‘Uses of Great Men.’</p>

<p>Plato is the man who makes havoc with originalities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
the philosopher whose writings have been
for twenty-two hundred years the Bible of the
learned, but who has his defects. Intellectual in
aim, and therefore literary, he attempts a system
of the universe and fails to complete it or make it
intelligible.</p>

<p>Swedenborg is the representative of mysticism,
great with its power, weak with its defects.</p>

<p>Out of the eternal conflict between abstractionist
and materialist arises another type of mind, one
that laughs at both philosophies for being out
of their depth and pushing too far. He is the
sceptic, Montaigne, for example. The type was
peculiarly grateful to Emerson, admiring as he did a
man who talked with shrewdness, was not literary,
who knew the world, used the positive degree,
never shrieked, and had no wish to annihilate
time and space.</p>

<p>Shakespeare meets our conception of the Poet,
‘a heart in unison with his time and country,’
whose production comes ‘freighted with the
weightiest convictions and pointed with the most
determined aims which any man or class knows
of in his times.’ He demonstrated the possibility
of translating things into song. The ear is ravished
by the beauty of his lines, ‘yet the sentence
is so loaded with meaning and so linked with its
foregoers and followers, that the logician is satisfied.’
And he had the royal trait of cheerfulness.</p>

<p>In Napoleon we have ‘the strong and ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
actor’ who in the ‘universal imbecility, indecision,
and indolence of men’ knows how to take occasion
by the beard. His life is an answer to cowardly
doubts. Emerson calls Napoleon ‘the agent or
attorney of the middle class of modern society.’
It was he who showed what could be done by the
use of common virtues. His experiment failed because
he had a selfish and sensual aim. In the last
analysis Napoleon was not a gentleman.</p>

<p>Goethe is the other phase of the genius of the age.
There is a provision for the writer in the scheme
of things. Nature insists on being reported. To
Man the universe is something to be recorded.
The instinct exists in different degrees. One has
the power to ‘see connection where the multitude
sees fragments.’ Lift this faculty to a high
degree and you have the great German poet who
well-nigh restored literature to its primal significance.
‘There must be a man behind the book.’
‘The old Eternal Genius who built the world has
confided himself more to this man than any other.’
Goethe is the type of culture. Here, too, is his
defect. For his devotion is not to pure truth, but
to truth for the sake of culture.</p>

<p><i>Representative Men</i> was succeeded by <i>English
Traits</i>, a volume in which Emerson taught his
countrymen more about England than they had
hitherto known or fancied. Histories, statistical
reports, treatises on British art and British manufactures,
are useful and sometimes dreary reading;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
they give us facts heaped on facts. It is a relief
to put them down and take up <i>English Traits</i> in
order to learn what we have been reading about.</p>

<p>Through Emerson’s eyes we can see this little
island ‘a prize for the best race,’ its singular people,
chained to their logic, willing ‘to kiss the dust
before a fact,’ strong in their sense of brotherhood,
yet fond each of his own way, incommunicable,
‘in short every one of these islanders an
island in himself.’ They have a ‘superfluity of
self-regard’—which is a secret of their power;
they are assertive, crotchety, wholly forgetful of
‘a cardinal article in the bill of social rights,’ that
every man ‘has a right to his own ears;’ nevertheless
Emerson concludes (and an Englishman
would assure him no other conclusion was possible)
they are the best stock in the world. Here
is the typical islander as Emerson paints him.
‘He is a churl with a soft place in his heart, whose
speech is a brash of bitter waters, but who loves
to help you at a pinch. He says no, and serves
you, and your thanks disgust him.’</p>

<p>There are paragraphs and chapters on the Aristocracy,
the Universities, Religion, Literature, and
the Press, that is, the ‘Times.’ Every page glitters
with wit. Every apothegm contains the full
proportion of truth and untruth which sayings of
that sort are wont to contain. Says Emerson:
‘The gospel the Anglican church preaches is,
‘“By taste are ye saved.”’ Yet the more one reflects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
on this monstrous statement, the more is he
astonished at the amount of truth in it.</p>

<p>The volume entitled <i>Conduct of Life</i> has a fine
rough vigor. Here are displayed to advantage
Emerson’s robust habit of mind, searching analysis,
vivacity and picturesqueness of expression,
epigrammatic skill, homely plain sense, and lofty
idealism. The first essay, ‘Fate,’ is an energetic
and striking performance. One needs the optimism
of its last paragraphs to counteract the grim
terror of the earlier ones. Seldom has the relentless
ferocity of Circumstance, Fate, Environment,
been set forth in terms equally emphatic. The
companion essay, ‘Power,’ is a study of the influence
of brute force (and its compensations) in
life and history. Emerson shows the value of the
‘bruiser’ in politics, trade, and in society. This
leads to the third subject, ‘Wealth.’ Money must
be had if only to buy bread. Nature insults the
man who will not work. ‘She starves, taunts,
and torments him, takes away warmth, laughter,
sleep, friends and daylight, until he has fought
his way to his own loaf.’ But what men of sense
want is power, mastery, not candy; they esteem
wealth to be ‘the assimilation of nature to themselves.’</p>

<p>To all this there must be a corrective; it is discussed
in the essay on ‘Culture.’ Nature ruins a
man to gain her ends, makes him strong in things
she wants done, weak otherwise, and then robs him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
of his sense of proportion so that he becomes
an egotist. Culture restores the balance. Culture
rescues a man from himself, ‘kills his exaggeration.’
The simpler means to it are books, travel,
society, solitude; and there are nobler ones, not
the least of which is adversity. The discussion is
continued in the practical essay on ‘Behavior’
and lifted to the highest plane in the essay on
‘Worship.’ The whole state of man is a state of
culture, ‘and its flowering and completion may be
described as Religion or Worship.’ For all its
beauty this chapter will not please many people.
They may take refuge in ‘Considerations by the
Way,’ which shows the ‘good of evil,’ or in the
fine essay on ‘Beauty’ or the ironical little closing
piece called ‘Illusions.’</p>

<span class="subhead">THE POEMS</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Many</span> paragraphs in <i>Nature</i> and the <i>Essays</i> struggle
in their prose environment as if seeking a
higher medium of expression. Emerson’s command
of poetic materials was extraordinary, though
it fails to justify the claims sometimes made for
him. He could be wilfully careless in respect to
technique. There are moments when no cacophonous
combination terrifies him. Then will he say
his say though the language creak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>He had published freely in ‘The Dial,’ where
he met his own little audience, but when the question
arose of putting his verses in the pretentious
form of a book Emerson hesitated. Only after
much deliberation, continued through four years,
did he come finally to a decision.</p>

<p>His capital theme is Nature, ‘the inscrutable
and mute.’ ‘Woodnotes,’ ‘Monadnock,’ ‘May-Day,’
‘My Garden,’ ‘Sea-Shore,’ ‘Song of Nature,’
‘Nature,’ ‘The Snow Storm,’ ‘Waldeinsamkeit,’
‘Musketaquit,’ ‘The Adirondacs,’ are
varied renderings of the subject. Among the lines
which haunt the memory, take for example this
description of the <span class="locked">sea:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The opaline, the plentiful and strong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet beautiful as is the rose in June,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And, in my mathematic ebb and flow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Giving a hint of that which changes not.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Splendid imagery and rich coloring mark the
fine passages in ‘May-Day’ describing the advance
of <span class="locked">summer:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">As poured the flood of the ancient sea</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spilling over mountain chains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bending forests as bends the sedge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Faster flowing o’er the plains,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A world-wide wave with a foaming edge</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">So pours the deluge of the heat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Broad northward o’er the land,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Azaleas flush the island floors,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the tints of heaven reply.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Leaving to one side the mere external shows of
the world, and calling in science to aid imagination,
the poet strikes out stanzas like these from
the ‘Song of <span class="locked">Nature:’—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I wrote the past in characters</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of rock and fire the scroll,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The building in the coral sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The planting of the coal.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And thefts from satellites and rings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And broken stars I drew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And out of spent and aged things</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I formed the world anew;</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">What time the gods kept carnival,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tricked out in star and flower,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in cramp elf and saurian forms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They swathed their too much power.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘Hamatreya,’ the exquisite ‘Rhodora,’ and the
musical allegory ‘Two Rivers’ are important as
showing the part played by Nature in Emerson’s
verse.</p>

<p>Certain poems repeat (or anticipate) the ideas of
the essays. ‘Brahma,’ for example, is an incomparable
setting of the doctrine of the universal
soul or ground of all <span class="locked">things:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">The vanished gods to me appear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And one to me are shame and fame.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘The Sphinx’ announces, in a sphinx-like
manner it must be acknowledged, though with
rare beauty in individual lines, the doctrine of
man’s relation to all existences, comprehending
one phase of which man has the key to the whole.
‘Uriel’ is a declaration of the poet’s faith in good
out of evil. ‘The Problem’ teaches the imminence
of the <span class="locked">Infinite:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The hand that rounded Peter’s dome</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And groined the aisles of Christian Rome</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">He builded better than he knew;—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The conscious stone to beauty grew.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Rich in thought and abounding in genuine
poetic gold are ‘The World-Soul,’ ‘The Visit,’
‘Destiny,’ ‘Days’ (Emerson’s perfect poem),
‘Forerunners,’ ‘Xenophanes,’ ‘The Day’s Ration,’
and the ‘Ode to Beauty.’</p>

<p>‘Merlin’ and ‘Saadi’ treat of the poet and his
mission. The one is a protest against the tinkling
rhyme, an art without substance; the other
exalts the calling of the bard, but warns him that
while he has need of men and they of him, the
true poet dwells alone. Together with these
suggestive verses should be read the posthumous
fragment originally intended for a masque.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>Of his occasional and patriotic poems the ‘Concord
Hymn,’ sung at the dedication of the battle
monument in 1837, must be held an imperishable
part of our young literature. The winged words
of the first stanza are among the not-to-be-forgotten
things, and there is rare beauty in the second
<span class="locked">stanza:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The foe long since in silence slept;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Alike the conqueror silent sleeps;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Time the ruined bridge has swept</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For the Concord celebration of 1857 Emerson
wrote the ‘Ode’ beginning</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O tenderly the haughty day</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fills his blue urn with fire;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and for the ‘Jubilee Concert’ in Music Hall, on
the day Emancipation went into effect, the ‘Boston
Hymn,’ with the bold <span class="locked">stanzas:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">God said, I am tired of kings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I suffer them no more;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">A field of havoc and war,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where tyrants great and tyrants small</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might harry the weak and poor?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The best of Emerson’s patriotic poems is the
‘Voluntaries,’ containing the often quoted and
perfect <span class="locked">lines:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So nigh is grandeur to our dust,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So near is God to man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Duty whispers low, <i>Thou must</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The youth replies, <i>I can</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>
<p>The personal poems are ‘Good-Bye,’ ‘Terminus,’
‘In Memoriam,’ ‘Dirge,’ and ‘Threnody.’
The last of the group is the poet’s lament for his
first-born, the ‘hyacinthine boy’ of five years, who
died in 1842. It is hardly worth the while to
compare these exquisite verses with some other
poem born of intense sorrow with a view to determining
whether they are greater, or less. Their
wondrous beauty is as palpable as it is unresembling.</p>

<p>Comparisons little befit Emerson the poet.
His muse was wayward. Extreme eulogists do
him injury by applying to him standards that
were none of his. They forget how he said of
himself that he was ‘not a poet, but a lover of
poetry and poets, and merely serving as a writer,
etc., in this empty America before the arrival of
poets.’ For the extravagancies of the extremists
the tempered admirers find themselves regularly
lectured, as if they were children who must have
it explained to them that Emerson was not a
Keats or a Shelley, or a Hugo.</p>

<p>Emerson as frequently gets less than he deserves
as more. What niggardly praise is that from the
pen of an eminent living English man of letters
who can only suppose that Emerson ‘knew what
he was about when he wandered into the fairyland
of verse, and that in such moments <i>he found
nothing better to his hand</i>!’ But the ‘Threnody,’
‘Monadnock,’ ‘May-Day,’ ‘Voluntaries,’ and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
‘The Problem,’ whatever else may be true of them,
are not the work of a man who found nothing
better to his hand.</p>

<span class="subhead">LATEST BOOKS</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Five</span> volumes remain to be commented on. The
first, <i>Society and Solitude</i> (so called after the initial
paper), is a group of twelve essays entitled ‘Civilization,’
‘Art,’ ‘Eloquence,’ ‘Domestic Life,’
‘Farming,’ ‘Works and Days,’ ‘Books,’ ‘Clubs,’
‘Courage,’ ‘Success,’ and ‘Old Age.’ They have
mostly a practical bent. That on ‘Books’ doubtless
gives an account of Emerson’s own reading,
adequate as far as it expresses his literary preferences,
inadequate respecting completeness. For
example, Emerson must have read George Borrow,
of an acquaintance with whom he repeatedly
gives proof, but these lists contain no mention of
<i>Lavengro</i> or <i>Romany Rye</i>. Here too will be found
his famous heresy about the value of translations,
but not so radically stated by Emerson as it is
sometimes stated by those who propose to attack
Emerson’s position.</p>

<p><i>Letters and Social Aims</i> (a volume forced from
him by the rumor that an English house proposed
to reprint his early papers from ‘The Dial’) covers
topics as diverse as, on the one hand, ‘Social Aims,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
‘Quotation and Originality,’ ‘The Comic,’ and on
the other, ‘Poetry and Imagination,’ ‘Inspiration,’
‘Greatness,’ ‘Immortality.’ There are also essays
on ‘Eloquence,’ ‘Resources,’ ‘Progress of Culture,’
and ‘Persian Poetry.’</p>

<p><i>Lectures and Biographical Sketches</i> consists of
nineteen pieces, among which will be found ‘Historic
Notes of Life and Letters in New England,’
‘The Superlative,’ and the brilliant sketches
of Thoreau, of Ezra Ripley, and of Carlyle.</p>

<p><i>Miscellanies</i> (not to be confounded with the
volume of 1849 bearing the same title) contains a
number of papers and addresses on political topics,
and is indispensable to the student of Emerson’s
life. Here will be found his speeches on John
Brown, on the Fugitive Slave Law, on Emancipation
in the West Indies, on American Civilization,
on Lincoln, and that inspiring lecture, ‘The
Fortune of the Republic.’</p>

<p><i>Natural History of Intellect and Other Papers</i> is
made up of lectures from the Harvard University
course (1870–71) and earlier courses, and a sheaf
of papers from ‘The Dial,’ mostly on ‘Modern
Literature.’ He who deplores the curtness of the
note on Tennyson in <i>English Traits</i> will be glad
to seek comfort in this earlier tribute. Yet the
comfort may prove to be less than he would like.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Emerson’s audience is large and varied. Let us
consider a few among the varieties of those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
are attracted by his genius and the charm of his
personality.</p>

<p>To certain hardy investigators Emerson is not
a mere man of letters whose thought, radiantly
clothed, takes the philosophical form, he is a philosopher
almost in the strict sense. They find a
place for him in their classification. They know
exactly what ideas, derived from what pundits,
have come out with what new inflection in his
writings. They have done for Emerson more than
he could do, or perhaps cared to do, for himself;
they have given him a system.</p>

<p>All this is important and valuable. No little
praise is due to results worked out with so much
courage and critical acumen. Whether the conclusions
are quite true is another question.</p>

<p>Doubtless, too, there are readers who, taking
their cue from the class just mentioned, find their
self-love flattered as they turn the pages of the
<i>Essays</i> and the <i>Conduct of Life</i>. Not only, in
spite of dark sayings here and there, does ‘philosophy’
prove easier and more delightful than
they were wont to think, but their estimate of their
own mental powers is immensely enlarged.</p>

<p>There are the critics of letters whose function is
interpretative, and whose influence is restraining.
Solicitous to do their author justice, they are above
all solicitous that injustice shall not be done him
by overpraise. They bring proof that Emerson
was not a precursor of Darwin, that he was inferior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
to Carlyle, that he was not a poet, that he was
never a great and not always a good writer, that
he was apt to impose on his reader as a new truth
an old error in ‘a novel and fascinating dress,’ that
he was even capable of writing words without ideas.</p>

<p>But the motives which draw and bind to him
the great majority of Emerson’s readers are connected
with literature rather than philosophy or
criticism. A prerogative of the man of letters is
to be read both for what he says and for the way
he says it. In the case of Emerson his thought
may not be divided from the verbal setting. ‘He
can never get beyond the English language.’ ‘No
merely French, or German, or Italian reader will
have the least notion of the magic of his diction.’<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>Perhaps in the long run they get the most out
of Emerson who read him not for stimulus, for
his militant optimism, for the shock his fine-phrased
audacities give their humdrum opinions,
for his uplifting idealism (all of which they are
sure to get and profit by), but who read him for
literary pleasure, for downright good-fellowship,
and for the humor that is in him. That he attracts
a large audience of this (seemingly) unimportant
class is enough to show how little danger there
is that Emerson will be handed over to the keeping
of the merely erudite and bookish part of the
public.</p>

<p>It is well to remember that he had no intention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
of being so disposed of. When he said, ‘My own
habitual view is to the well being of students or
scholars,’ he was careful immediately to explain
that he used the word ‘student’ in no restricted
sense. ‘The class of scholars or students ... is
a class that comprises in some sort all mankind,
comprises every man in the best hours of his life.’
He pictures the newsboy entering a train filled with
men going to business. The morning papers are
bought, and ‘instantly the entire rectangular assembly,
fresh from their breakfast, are bending
as one man to their second breakfast.’ This was
Emerson’s student body, this was the audience he
aimed to reach.</p>

<p>Did he reach this body? It is believed that he
did, if not always directly, then vicariously. He was
compelled as a matter of course to speak in his
own way—the impossible thing for him was to
do violence to his genius. Emerson invented the
phrase, ‘the man in the street.’ Now it is notorious
that the man in the street cares little about
the ‘over-soul.’ The mere juxtaposition of the
two expressions is comic. But Emerson did not
talk of the over-soul all the time. He had a Franklin-like
common-sense and a pithiness of speech
which are captivating. Perhaps in magnifying his
idealism we have neglected to do justice to his
mundane philosophy.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Poe</span> was of Irish extraction. His great-grandfather,
John Poe, came to America about
1745 and settled near Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
John Poe’s son David (known in the annals of
Baltimore as ‘old General Poe’) rendered notable
services to his country during the Revolution.
Lafayette remembered him well and during a visit
to Baltimore in 1824 asked to be taken to the
place where Poe was buried. ‘Ici repose un cœur
noble,’ said Lafayette as he knelt and kissed the
old patriot’s grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>Of General Poe’s six children, the eldest, David,
was to have been bred to the law, but his tastes
led him first to the amateur and then to the professional
stage. He married a young English actress,
Mrs. Elizabeth (Arnold) Hopkins. They
had three children, William, Edgar, and Rosalie.
Edgar (afterwards known as Edgar Allan) was
born in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 19,
1809.</p>

<p>The young family suffered the petty miseries
incident to the life of strolling players, and became
at one time very poor. The circumstances of
David Poe’s death and the place of his burial are
unknown. When Mrs. Poe died at Richmond,
Virginia, in December, 1811, Edgar was taken by
Mrs. John Allan, the wife of a highly respected
merchant of that city, and was brought up as a
child of the house.</p>

<p>The Allans were in England from 1815 to 1820.
During this time Poe was placed at Manor House
School, Stoke Newington. He afterwards attended
the English and Classical School in Richmond and
on February 14, 1826, matriculated at the University
of Virginia. His connection with the University
ceased in December of the same year. He
left behind him a reputation for marked abilities,
but he is said to have lost caste by his recklessness
in card playing. Allan positively refused to
pay the youth’s gambling debts, which amounted
to twenty-five hundred dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p>Placed in Allan’s counting-house, Poe was unhappy
and rebellious, and finally disappeared. He
declared in after years that he went abroad to offer
his services to the Greeks. What he really did
was to enlist in the United States army under the
name of Edgar A. Perry. During the summer of
1827 he was with Battery H of the First Artillery
at Fort Independence, Boston. In August of that
year he published <i>Tamerlane and Other Poems, by a
Bostonian</i>. The edition was small and the pamphlet
has become one of the rarest of bibliographical
curiosities.</p>

<p>Battery H was sent to Fort Moultrie, South
Carolina, in October, 1827, and a year later to
Fortress Monroe, Virginia. At some time during
this period Poe must have made his whereabouts
known to the Allans. Mrs. Allan, who was tenderly
attached to Poe, may have succeeded in bringing
about an understanding between the youth and
his foster father. When she died (in February,
1829) Poe lost his best friend.</p>

<p>Allan, however, did what he could to forward
the young man’s newest ambition, which was to
enter the Military Academy at West Point. He
paid for a substitute in the army and wrote letters
to men who were influential in such matters, with
the result that Poe was enrolled at the Academy
on July 1, 1830. He gave his age as nineteen
years and five months. His prematurely old look
led to the invention of the story that the appointment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
was really procured for Poe’s son, but the
son having died the father had taken his place.</p>

<p>While the question of the appointment was
pending, Poe spent some time in Baltimore and
there published his second volume of verse, <i>Al
Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems</i> (1829).</p>

<p>The accounts of his life at the Academy are not
so divergent as to be contradictory. One classmate
noted the youth’s censorious manner: ‘I
never heard him speak in terms of praise of any
English writer, living or dead.’ Excelling in
French and mathematics, Poe by intentional neglect
of military duty brought about his own dismissal.
He was court-martialled and left West
Point on March 7, 1831. He had previously
taken subscriptions among his friends for a new
book of verse. It was published in New York
(1831) under the title of <i>Poems</i>, ‘second edition,’
and was dedicated to ‘the U. S. Corps of Cadets,’
who are said to have been disappointed at finding
in its pages none of the local squibs with which
the author had been wont to amuse them.</p>

<p>Poe is next heard of in Baltimore, where he
seems to have made his home with his father’s
sister, Mrs. Maria Clemm, a widow with one child,
Virginia. In 1833 ‘The Saturday Visiter’ of Baltimore
offered two prizes—one hundred dollars
for a story, fifty for a poem. Poe submitted a
manuscript volume entitled ‘Tales of the Folio
Club,’ and was given one award for his famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
‘MS. Found in a Bottle.’ Had not the conditions
of the contest precluded giving both prizes
to the same person, he would have received the
other award for his poem ‘The Coliseum.’</p>

<p>Through John P. Kennedy, one of the judges
in the contest, Poe came into relations with T. W.
White, the proprietor of ‘The Southern Literary
Messenger,’ published at Richmond. His contributions
were heartily welcomed. White then
invited Poe to become his editorial associate. The
offer was accepted and Poe went to Richmond.
Mrs. Clemm and Virginia followed, and in May,
1836, Poe was married to his cousin. A private
marriage is said to have taken place at Baltimore
the preceding September.</p>

<p>The arrangement entered into by White and
Poe was most propitious. The proprietor of
the ‘Messenger’ had obtained the services of a
young man with a positive genius for the work in
hand,—a young man who was able to contribute
such tales as ‘Berenice,’ ‘Morella,’ ‘Hans Pfaall,’
‘Metzengerstein,’ besides poems, miscellanies,
and caustic book-criticisms. On the other hand,
Poe had, if a small, at least a regular income. He
could not buy luxury with a salary of five hundred
and twenty dollars, but it was a beginning, and an
increase was promised. Moreover, he was in the
hands of a man who regarded him with affection no
less than admiration. Unfortunately the arrangement
was not to last. Poe had become the victim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
of a hereditary vice.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> Whether he drank much
or little is of less consequence than the fact that
after a period of indulgence he was wholly unfitted
for work. Once when Poe was temporarily in
Baltimore, White wrote him that if he returned
to the office it must be with the understanding
that all engagements were at an end the moment
he ‘got drunk.’ Kennedy explained Poe’s leaving
the ‘Messenger’ thus: He was ‘irregular,
eccentric, and querulous, and soon gave up his
place.’</p>

<p>From Richmond, Poe went to New York,
attracted by some promise in connection with a
magazine. He lived in Carmine Street, and Mrs.
Clemm contributed to the family support by taking
boarders. In July, 1838, was published <i>The
Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</i>. A month later
Poe removed to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>He contributed to annuals and magazines and
had a hand in a piece of hack-work, <i>The Conchologist’s
First Book</i> (1839). This same year he became
assistant editor of ‘Burton’s Gentleman’s
Magazine and American Monthly,’ a periodical
owned by the actor, William E. Burton, and held
his position until June, 1840. The irregularity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
and querulousness which Kennedy had remarked
led to misunderstandings. How the two men differed
in policy becomes plain from a letter to Poe
in which Burton says: ‘You must, my dear sir,
get rid of your avowed ill feelings towards your
brother authors.’ There was a quarrel, and Poe,
who had some command of the rhetoric of abuse,
described Burton as ‘a blackguard and a villain.’</p>

<p>The year 1840 was notable in the history of
American letters, for then appeared the first collected
edition of Poe’s prose writings, <i>Tales of the
Grotesque and Arabesque</i>. The edition, of seven
hundred and fifty copies, was in two volumes and
contained twenty-five stories, among them ‘Morella,’
‘William Wilson,’ ‘The Fall of the House
of Usher,’ ‘Ligeia,’ ‘Berenice,’ and ‘The Conversation
of Eiros and Charmion’.</p>

<p>Poe, a born ‘magazinist,’ cherished the ambition
of editing a periodical of his own in which, as he
phrased it, he could ‘kick up a dust.’ He secured
a partner and actually announced that ‘The Penn
Magazine’ would begin publication on January 1,
1841. Compelled to postpone his project, he undertook
the editorship of ‘Graham’s Magazine,’ a
new monthly formed by uniting the ‘Gentleman’s,’
which Graham had bought, and ‘The Casket.’
From February, 1841, to June, 1842, Poe contributed
to every number of the new magazine, printing,
among other things, ‘The Murders in the Rue
Morgue,’ ‘The Mystery of Marie Rogêt,’ and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
‘The Masque of the Red Death.’ Griswold succeeded
him in the editorial chair. Poe gave as a
reason for resigning his place ‘disgust with the
namby-pamby character of the magazine.’ In the
hope of bettering his fortune, he sought a place
in the Philadelphia Custom House, but was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding frequent set-backs, he had it
in his power at any time to attract public notice.
In 1843 he won a hundred-dollar prize for his
story ‘The Gold-Bug,’ printed in the ‘Dollar
Newspaper,’ and he lectured with success on ‘The
Poets and Poetry of America.’ But the field was
barren and Poe determined on going to New York.
Within a week after his arrival in that city (April,
1844) he printed in ‘The Sun’ his famous ‘Balloon
Hoax.’ In October he began work on ‘The
Evening Mirror,’ Willis’s paper, and on January
29, 1845, ‘The Raven’ appeared in its columns
and was the poetical sensation of the day. The
next month he lectured on American Poetry in
the library of the New York Historical Society.
Dissatisfied with the ‘Mirror,’ he accepted a proposition
from C. F. Briggs to become one of the
editors of ‘The Broadway Journal.’ Later Poe
became the sole editor, and for a brief time enjoyed
the ambition of his life, the control of a paper of
his own. He is said to have doubled the circulation
in the four months during which he filled the
editorial chair. Unfortunately he lacked capital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
and could by no means secure it. ‘The Broadway
Journal’ stopped publication.</p>

<p>While editing the ‘Journal’ Poe was invited to
read an original poem before the Boston Lyceum.
He gave a juvenile piece, and when criticised, defended
himself with curious want of tact. That he
might lose no opportunity to alienate his contemporaries,
he began publishing in ‘Godey’s Lady’s
Book’ a series of papers entitled ‘The Literati,’
in which he gave free rein to his propensity to
‘kick up a dust.’ The irony of his situation might
well excite pity. He who most loathed a combination
of literature and fashion plates was driven
for support to the journals which made such a
combination their chief feature.</p>

<p>At the close of 1845 was published <i>The Raven
and Other Poems</i>, the first collected edition of Poe’s
verse. Occasionally the poet was seen at literary
gatherings, where he left the most agreeable impression
by his manner, appearance, and conversation.
But his fortunes steadily declined, and in
1846, after he had moved to Fordham, a suburb
of New York, he fell into desperate straits. His
frail little wife, always an invalid, grew steadily
worse. An appeal was made through the journals
in behalf of the unfortunate family. Mrs. Poe died
on January 30, 1847. Her husband’s grief was so
poignant that it is with amazement one reads of
the strange affairs of the heart following this event.</p>

<p>Recovering from the severe illness which followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
his wife’s death, Poe resumed work. He
lectured and he wrote. <i>Eureka</i> was published early
in 1847. The consuming desire to own and edit
a magazine was no less consuming, and he made
some progress towards founding ‘The Stylus.’</p>

<p>The summer of 1849 Poe spent in Richmond
and was received with cordiality. He proposed
marriage to Mrs. Shelton of that city, a wealthy
widow, somewhat older than himself, and was accepted.
On the last of September he started for
New York to get Mrs. Clemm and bring her to
Richmond. He was found almost unconscious on
October 3 at Baltimore, in a saloon used as a voting
place, was taken to a hospital, and died at five
o’clock on the morning of October 7, 1849.</p>

<h3 id="sec_37">II<br />

<span class="subhead">POE’S CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Poe’s</span> wilfulness in marring his own fortunes bordered
on fatuity. At an age when men give over
youthful excesses merely because they are incongruous,
he had not so much as begun to ‘settle
down.’ The appropriate period for sowing wild
oats is brief at best. Nothing justifies an undue
prolongation. It were absurd to take the lofty tone
with a man of genius because at the age of seventeen
he carried to extreme the indulgences characteristic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
of the youth of his time, or because at
eighteen he ran away from a book-keeper’s desk
to join the army. Impulsiveness and vacillation
are not wholly bad things at eighteen; but at thirty
they are ridiculous.</p>

<p>Poe’s abuse of liquor and opium has long been
well understood, and the question of his responsibility
handed over to the decision of the medical
faculty. If many of his troubles sprang from this
abuse, many more arose out of his unwillingness
to recognize the fact that he was a part of society,
not an isolated and self-sufficient being. As a
genius he was entitled to his prerogative. He was
also a man among men and under the same obligations
to continued fair dealing, courtesy, patience,
and forbearance as were his fellows. In these matters
he was notoriously deficient. No one could
have been more eager for praise and sympathy than
Poe. He asked for both and received in the measure
of his asking. Men of influence helped him
ungrudgingly. They lent him money, commended
his work, defended him at first from the criticism
of those who thought they had suffered at his
hands; but it was to no purpose. By his perversity
and capriciousness (as also by an occasional
display of that which in a less highly endowed
man than he would have been called malevolence)
Poe alienated those who were most inclined to
befriend him. Nevertheless he wondered that
friends fell away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p>With a powerful mind, a towering imagination,
a natural command of the technical part of literature,
which he improved by tireless exercise, and
with no little spontaneity of productive energy,
Poe remained a boy in character, self-willed,
spoiled, ungrateful, petulant. The sharper the
lash of fortune’s whip on his shoulders, the more
rebellious he became.</p>

<p>The affair of the Boston Lyceum illustrates
Poe’s singular disregard of what is expected of
men supposed to know the ways of the world. A
Southern paper commenting on this affair said
that Poe should not have gone to Boston. The
implication was that as Poe had been attacking
the New Englanders for years he could not expect
fair treatment. Poe had indeed often attacked
the ‘Frogpondians,’ as he enjoyed calling them,
and they invited him to come and read an original
poem on an occasion of some local importance.
This may have been a mark of innocence on the
part of the ‘Frogpondians;’ it can hardly be
construed as indicative of narrowness or prejudice.
Poe accepted their hospitality apparently in the
spirit in which it was offered, read one of his old
poems, and declared afterward that he wrote it
before completing his tenth year, and that he considered
it would answer sufficiently well for an
audience of Transcendentalists: ‘It was the best
we had—for the price—and it <i>did</i> answer
remarkably well.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

<p>The episode is of no importance save as it illustrates
Poe’s attitude towards the game of life.
Poe expected other men to play the game strictly
according to the rules, for himself he would play
the game in his own way. And he did. But he
could not go on breaking the rules indefinitely.
They who had his real interest at heart told him
as much. Simms, the novelist, wrote Poe in July,
1846, that he deeply deplored his misfortunes—‘the
more so as I see no process for your relief
but such as must result from your own decision
and resolve.’ The letter should be read in its
entirety. It does honor to the writer’s manly
nature, and it throws no little light on the enigmatic
character of Poe.</p>

<h3 id="sec_38">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE PROSE WRITER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Poe’s</span> genius was essentially journalistic. In his
prose writing he aimed at an immediate effect, and
he knew exactly how to produce it. The journalist
does not in general write with a view to the
influence his paragraph will produce week after
next. The paper will have disappeared week after
next, if not day after to-morrow. Though his
theme be the eternal verities, the journalist must
write as if he had but the one chance to speak on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
that subject. He will therefore be direct, positive,
clear, seeking to persuade, convince, irritate, amuse.</p>

<p>The most obvious characteristics of Poe’s style
are found in his clarity, his vividness, his precision,
in the dense shadows and the high lights, in the
hundred unnamed but distinctly felt marks of the
journalistic style. Whatever he proposes to do,
that he does. There is no fumbling. Even his
mysteries are as certain as the stage effects in a
spectacular drama; they seem to come at the
turning of an electric switch or the inserting of a
blue glass before the lime light. In reality the
process is much more complicated. Other magicians
have essayed to produce like effects by turning
the same switch, with disastrous result.</p>

<p>Poe was a diligent seeker after literary finish.
He was painstaking, and would polish and retouch
a paragraph when to the eye of a good
judge there was nothing left to do by way of improvement.
‘He seemed never to regard a story
as finished.’<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>He was over emphatic at times, and like
De Quincey, many of whose irritating mannerisms
he had caught, made a childish use of italics. But
he had no need of these adventitious supports. It
was enough for him to state a thing in his inimitable
manner. While his vocabulary was for the
most part simple, he was not without his verbal
affectations. He loved words surcharged with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
poetic suggestion. A lamp never hangs from the
ceiling, it ‘depends.’ One of his favorite words
is ‘domain.’ The black ‘tarn’ which mirrors the
house of Usher he could have called by no other
term. ‘Lake,’ or ‘pond,’ or ‘pool’ would not
have done. The word must be remote, suggestive,
mysterious.</p>

<p>His style often glows with prismatic colors, but
the colors seem to be refracted from ice. There
is no warmth, no sweetness, no lovable and human
quality. All the pronounced characteristics
of Poe’s style are intensely and coldly intellectual.
It is easier to admire his use of language than to
like it.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>TALES OF THE GROTESQUE AND
ARABESQUE</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">By</span> virtue of his journalistic gift, Poe resembled
the author of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. He could not, like
Defoe, have become general literary purveyor to
the people, but he was quite ready to profit by
what was uppermost in the public mind. <i>The
Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</i> is an illustration,
as it is also a good example of Poe’s art in its
most mundane form. It recounts the adventures
of a runaway lad at sea. Mutiny, drunkenness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
brawling, murder, shipwreck, cannibalism, madness,
are the chief ingredients of the book. It is
minute, circumstantial, prolix, matter of fact. The
air of verisimilitude is increased by an alternation
of episodes of thrilling interest with tedious accounts
of how a cargo should be stowed, and the
object and method of bringing a ship to. Only at
rare intervals does Poe’s peculiar genius flash out.</p>

<p>As the longest of his writings the <i>Narrative</i> has
a peculiar value. By it we are able to get some
notion of his power for ‘sustained effort,’ to use
a phrase that always irritated him. That power
was certainly not great; perhaps it was never fairly
tested. <i>The Journal of Julius Rodman</i> is a second
attempt at the same kind of fiction. Poe was less
happy in descriptions of the prairie than of the sea;
the interest of the <i>Journal</i> is feeble.</p>

<p>In these fictions the author holds fast to tangible
things. Pym and Rodman might have had the
adventures they recount. In another group of
stories Poe leavens fact with imagination. Such are
‘The Balloon Hoax,’ ‘The Unparalleled Adventure
of one Hans Pfaall,’ ‘A Descent into the
Maelström,’ and the ‘MS. Found in a Bottle.’
Real or alleged science is compounded with the
elements of wonder and mystery. And with these
elements comes an increase of power.</p>

<p>Poe, who was never backward in giving himself
the credit he thought his due, often failed to understand
where his own most marvellous achievements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
lay. In ‘Hans Pfaall’ he claimed originality
in the use of scientific data. Had his stories
only this to recommend them, they would long
since have been forgotten. Nothing so quickly
becomes old-fashioned as popular science. The
display of knowledge about aerial navigation in
‘Hans Pfaall’ perhaps made a brave show in 1836,
but it is childish now. A Hans Pfaall of the
Twentieth Century would descend on Rotterdam
in a dirigible balloon, and if questioned would be
found to entertain enlightened views on storage
batteries. Poe talked glibly about sines and cosines
and brought noisy charges of astronomical
ignorance against his brother writers, but it was
not in these things that his genius displayed itself,
it was rather in the way this wonder-worker makes
one aware of the illimitable stretches of space, the
appalling vastness, the silence, the mystery, terror,
and majesty of Nature. He is the clever craftsman
in his account of how the Dutch bellows-mender
started on his aerial travels. But when in two or
three paragraphs Poe conveys a sense of height so
terrific that the plain fireside reader, indisposed
to balloon ascensions, grasps the arms of his chair
and clings to the floor with the toes of his slippers
lest he fall—then does he display a power with
which popular science has nothing to do.</p>

<p>This is true of ‘A Descent into the Maelström.’
What scientific fact went into the composition of
the piece appears to have been taken from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
<i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, but the valuable part, the
sense of life and movement, the crash of the storm,
the roar of the waves, the shriek of the vortex, like
the cry of lost souls, all this is not to be found in
encyclopædias. The story can be read any number
of times and its magical power felt afresh each
time. But the first reading cannot be described
by so tame a phrase as a literary pleasure, it is an
experience.</p>

<p>Another masterpiece is the ‘MS. Found in a
Bottle.’ The din of the storm is not easily got
out of one’s ears. With the unnamed hero of the
tale we ‘stand aghast at the warring of wind and
ocean’ and are chilled by the ‘stupendous ramparts
of ice, towering away, into the desolate
sky.’</p>

<p>In another group of stories, ‘The Gold-Bug,’
the gruesome ‘Murders in the Rue Morgue,’
‘The Mystery of Marie Rogêt,’ and ‘The Purloined
Letter,’ the author fabricates mysteries
for the express purpose of unravelling them afterwards.
Poe, who seldom attempts the creation of
a character, actually created one in the person of
his famous detective. Dupin is a living being in a
world peopled for the most part with shadows.</p>

<p>Poe professed not to think much of his detective
stories. The ‘ratiocinative’ tale is not a high
order of literary achievement. Poe shares the
honors accruing from the invention of such puzzles
with Wilkie Collins, Gaboriau, and the ‘great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
‘Boisgobey,’ and they in turn with the most sensational
of sensation mongers.</p>

<p>‘The Gold-Bug’ afforded the author a vehicle
for giving expression to his delight in cryptography,
at the same time he availed himself of the perennial
human interest in the prospect of unearthing
buried treasure. ‘The Mystery of Marie Rogêt’
was based on a contemporary murder case. It contains
a minimum of that in which Poe often revelled,
namely physical horror, and a maximum of
the ratiocinative element. ‘The Purloined Letter’
is in lighter vein, and illustrates the comedy side of
Dupin’s adventures. Chevalier and minister cross
swords with admirable grace, but no blood is drawn.</p>

<p>The masterpiece of the group is ‘The Murders
in the Rue Morgue.’ Genuinely original, blood-curdling,
the story depends for its real force not
on the ingenious unravelling of a frightful mystery,
but on the sense of nameless horror which creeps
over us as little by little the outré character of the
tragedy is disclosed. We realize that in the dread
event of being murdered one might have a choice
as to how it was done. The predestined victim
might even pray to die by the hands of a plain
God-fearing assassin and not after the manner of
Madame L’Espanaye.</p>

<p>Of the stories classified as tales of conscience,
‘William Wilson,’ ‘The Man of the Crowd,’
‘The Imp of the Perverse,’ ‘The Tell-Tale Heart,’
and ‘The Black Cat,’ the first is not only the best,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
but is also one of the best of all stories in that
genre. The image of bodily corruption is not
present and the interest is held by perfectly legitimate
means. ‘The Black Cat’ is a fearful and
repulsive piece, and at the same time characteristic.
Poe hesitated at nothing when it came to working
out his theme. He who had such absolute control
of the materials of his art too seldom practised
reticence in exhibiting the gruesome details of a
scene of cruelty.</p>

<p>‘The Fall of the House of Usher’ is a representative
story, if not absolutely the best illustration
of Poe’s genius. The motive of premature
burial haunts him here as often elsewhere. But
the emphasis of this tragedy of a race is laid where
it belongs, in the terror of the thought of approaching
madness. Poe wrote many stories which
can be described each as the fifth act of a tragedy.
It may be doubted whether he surpassed ‘The
Fall of the House of Usher.’</p>

<p>‘Berenice,’ ‘Ligeia,’ and ‘Morella’ are highly
successful experiments in the realm of the morbidly
imaginative, and might be grouped under
Browning’s discarded title of ‘Madhouse Cells.’
The themes are monstrous, and are only saved
from being absurd by the author’s consummate
ability to carry the reader with him. Poe could
scale a fearful and slippery height, maintaining
himself with the slenderest excuse for a foot-hold.
A dozen times you would say he must fall, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
dozen times he passes the perilous point with
masterly ease. In the hands of a lesser artist than
he, how utterly absurd would be a scene like that
in ‘Ligeia’ where the opium-eater watches by the
bedside of his dead wife.</p>

<p>‘Metzengerstein’ and ‘A Tale of the Ragged
Mountains’ are stories of metempsychosis. ‘The
Cask of Amontillado’ and ‘Hop-Frog’ turn on
the motive of revenge. ‘The Pit and the Pendulum,’
an episode of the Inquisition, is a study of
the preternatural acuteness of the mind while the
body undergoes torture. ‘The Assignation’ is a
Venetian tale of love and intrigue, and would
have been conventional enough in the hands of
any one but Poe. The most powerful story in
the group is ‘The Red Death,’ a lurid drama of
revelry in the midst of pestilence.</p>

<p>Difficult as are the themes, and skilful as is
the handling, these tales are in a way surpassed
by the extraordinary group of romances in which
Poe describes the meeting of disembodied spirits.
‘The Power of Words,’ ‘The Colloquy of Monos
and Una,’ and ‘The Conversation of Eiros and
Charmion’ are excursions into a world unknown
to the rank and file of literary explorers, a world
where the most adventurous might well question
his ability to penetrate far. In these supermundane
pieces, in the prose-poems ‘Silence’ and
‘Shadow,’ in ‘Ligeia,’ and in ‘The Domain of
Arnheim,’ Poe’s art is indeed magical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>Poe seems to have been fully persuaded in his
own mind that he had the gift of humor. The
extravaganzas and farcical pieces bulk rather large
in his collected writings. In too many of them
the author cuts extraordinary mental capers in
the most mirthless way. ‘The Literary Life of
Thingum Bob, Esq.,’ ‘How to write a Blackwood
Article’ and its sequel, ‘A Predicament,’ satires
all on the ways of editors and men of letters, are
examples of Poe’s manner as a humorist. The
rattling monologue and dry, hard, uncontagious
laughter of a music-hall comedian is the nearest
parallel. The effect is wholly disproportionate to
the bewildering activity of the performer.</p>

<p>In farces like ‘The Spectacles,’ ‘Loss of Breath,’
and ‘The Man that was Used up,’ the motives
would be revolting were not the characters manifestly
constructed of wood or papier-maché. The
figures are neither more nor less than marionettes.
If Madame Stephanie Lalande (aged eighty-one)
dashes her wig on the ground with a yell and
dances a fandango upon it, ‘in an absolute ecstasy
and agony of rage,’ it is what may be expected
in a pantomime. Whoever wishes to laugh at the
hero of the Bugaboo and Kickapoo campaign,
when he is discovered sans scalp, sans palate, sans
arm, leg, and shoulders, is at liberty to do so, but
he must laugh as do children when Punch beats
his wife.</p>

<p>There is no question of the vivacity displayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
in these pieces. ‘Bon-Bon,’ ‘The Duc de l’Omelette,’
‘Lionizing,’ ‘Never bet the Devil your
Head,’ ‘X-ing a Paragrab,’ ‘Diddling Considered
as one of the Exact Sciences,’ ‘The
Business Man,’ and ‘The Angel of the Odd’
are sprightly with an uncanny sprightliness. It
must always be a matter for astonishment that
Poe could have written them. The mystery of their
being read is explained by the taste of the times.</p>

<p>On the other hand, ‘The Devil in the Belfry’
is genuinely amusing. The description of the
peaceful estate of the pleasant Dutch toy village
of Vondervotteimitiss, where the very pigs wore
repeaters tied to their tails with ribbons, and the
sad story of the destruction of all order and regularity
by the advent of the foreign-looking young
man in black kerseymere knee-breeches, are most
agreeably set forth. This extravaganza is not only
the best of Poe’s humorous sketches, but ranks
with the work of men who were better equipped
and more gifted in such work than was Poe.</p>

<h3 id="sec_40">V<br />

<span class="subhead">THE CRITIC</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Poe</span> brought into American criticism a pungency
which it had hitherto lacked. He was entirely independent,
and had urbanity companioned independence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
the value of his critical work would have
been greatly augmented. He could praise with
warmth and condemn with asperity; he could not
maintain an even temper. Swayed by his likes
and his dislikes, he was but too apt to grow extravagantly
commendatory or else spiteful. ‘He
had the judicial mind but was rarely in the judicial
state of mind.’<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> He was not unwilling to give
pain, and easily persuaded himself that he did so
in a just cause. There was a pleasurable sense of
power in the consciousness of being feared. Yet
the pleasure thus derived can never be other than
ignoble. A man of Poe’s genius can ill afford to
waste his time in attacking other men of genius
whose conceptions of literary art differ from his
own. Still less can he afford to assail the swarm of
petty authors whose works will perish the sooner
for being let alone. Of all harmless creatures
authors are the most harmless and should be allowed
to live their innocent little lives. But Poe
took literature hard, and authors had a disquieting
effect on him.</p>

<p>Accused of ‘mangling by wholesale,’ Poe denied
the charge, declaring that among the many critiques
he had written during a given period of ten
years not one was ‘wholly fault-finding or wholly
in approbation.’ And he maintained that to every
opinion expressed he had attempted to give weight
‘by something that bore the semblance of a reason.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Is there another writer in the land who
‘can of his own criticisms conscientiously say the
same’? Poe prided himself on an honesty of motive
such as animated Wilson and Macaulay. He
denied that his course was unpopular, pointing to
the fact that during his editorship of the ‘Messenger’
and ‘Graham’s’ the circulation of the
one had risen from seven hundred to five thousand,
and of the other ‘from five to fifty-two thousand
subscribers.’ ‘Even the manifest injustice of a
Gifford is, I grieve to say, an exceedingly popular
thing.’<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>Poe’s critical writings take the form of reviews
of books (‘Longfellow’s Ballads,’ ‘Moore’s “Alciphron,”’
‘Horne’s “Orion,”’ ‘Miss Barrett’s
“A Drama of Exile,”’ ‘Hawthorne’s Tales,’
etc.), polemical writings (‘A Reply to “Outis”’),
essays on the theory of literary art (‘The Poetic
Principle,’ ‘The Rationale of Verse’), brief notes
(‘Marginalia’), and short and snappy articles on
contemporary writers (‘The Literati’).</p>

<p>His theory of literary art may be studied in the
lecture entitled ‘The Poetic Principle,’ where he
maintains that there is no such thing as a long
poem, the very phrase being ‘a contradiction of
terms.’ A poem deserves its title ‘only inasmuch
as it excites by elevating the soul.’ This excitement
is transient. When it ceases, that which is
written ceases to be poetical. Poe even sets the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
precise limit of the excitement—‘half an hour at
the very utmost.’</p>

<p>He then attacks ‘the heresy of The Didactic,’
protesting against the doctrine that every poem
should contain a moral and the poetical merit estimated
by the moral. ‘The incitements of Passion,
or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons
of Truth, may be introduced into a poem with
advantage, but the true artist will always contrive
to tone them down in proper subjection to that
Beauty which is the atmosphere and the real essence
of the poem.’</p>

<p>Poe then proceeds to his definition of the ‘poetry
of words,’ which is, he says, ‘<i>The Rhythmical
Creation of Beauty</i>.’ Its sole arbiter is Taste.
‘With the Intellect, or with the Conscience, it has
only collateral relations. Unless incidentally, it
has no concern whatever either with Duty or with
Truth.’</p>

<p>In his concrete criticism Poe never hesitated to
prophesy. ‘I most heartily congratulate you upon
having accomplished a work which will <i>live</i>,’ he
wrote to Mrs. E. A. Lewis. Of some poem of
Longfellow’s he said that it would ‘not live.’
Possibly he was right in both cases, but how could
he know? Here is shown the weakness of Poe’s
critical temper. He affirmed positively that which
cannot positively be affirmed.</p>

<p>He was a monomaniac on plagiarism, forever
raising the cry of ‘Stop thief.’ Yet Poe, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
Molière, whom he resembled in no other particular,
‘took his own’ whenever it pleased him to
do so, and he was not over solicitous to advertise
his sources. He was in the right. If poets advertised
their sources, what would be left for the commentators
to do? Poe hinted that Hawthorne
appropriated his ideas, and he flatly accused Longfellow
of so doing. He was punished grotesquely,
for Chivers, the author of <i>Eonchs of Ruby</i>, accused
Poe (after the latter’s death, when it was
quite safe to do so) of getting many of his best
ideas from Chivers.</p>

<h3 id="sec_41">VI<br />

<span class="subhead">THE POET</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Poe’s</span> claim to mastership in verse rests on a
handful of lyrics distinguished for exquisite melody
and a haunting beauty of phrase. That part
of the public which estimates a poet by such
pieces as find their way into anthologies regards
Poe primarily as the author of ‘The Bells’ and
‘The Raven.’ If popularity were the final test
of merit, these strikingly original performances
would indeed crown his work. After sixty years,
neither has lost in appreciable degree the magical
charm it exerted when first the weird melody fell
upon the ear. Each is hackneyed beyond description;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
each has been parodied unmercifully, murdered
by raw elocutionists, and worse than murdered
by generations of school-children droning
from their readers, about the ‘midnight dreary’
and the ‘Runic rhyme.’ But it is yet possible
to restore in a measure the feeling of astonished
delight with which lovers of poetry greeted the
advent of these studies in the musical power of
words.</p>

<p>The practical and earnest soul will find little to
comfort him in the poetry of Poe. It teaches
nothing, emphasizes no moral, never inspires to
action. The strange unearthly melodies must be
enjoyed for the reason that they are strange and unearthly
and melodious. The genius of the poet has
travelled</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">By a route obscure and lonely,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Haunted by ill angels only,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where an Eidolon, named Night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On a black throne reigns upright,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and we can well believe that it comes</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">From an ultimate dim Thule,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Out of Space—out of Time.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Wholly out of space and time was he who wrote
‘Dreamland,’ ‘The City in the Sea,’ ‘The
Haunted Palace,’ ‘Israfel,’ ‘The Sleeper,’ and
‘Ulalume.’ It is idle to ask of these poems something
they do not pretend to give, and it can
hardly be other than uncritical to describe them as
‘very superficial.’ They are strange exotic flowers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
blooming under conditions the most adverse, a
fresh proof that genius is independent of place
and time.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In Poe’s work as a whole there is unquestionably
too much of brooding over death, the grave, mere
physical horrors. Since his genius lay that way, he
must be accepted as he was. But it is permitted
to regret, if not the thing in itself (the domain of
art being wide), at least the excess. Poe speaks
of certain themes which are ‘too entirely horrible
for the purposes of legitimate fiction. These the
mere romanticist must eschew, if he do not wish
to offend or to disgust.’ And having laid down
this doctrine, Poe goes on to relate the story of
‘The Premature Burial.’ It turns out a vision.
But the narrator affirms that he was cured by the
experience, that he read no more ‘bugaboo tales—<i>such
as this</i>. In short I became a new man and
lived a man’s life.’ Without assuming that Poe
spoke wholly from the autobiographical point of
view, we may believe the passage to contain a
measure of his actual thought.</p>

<p>We may claim for him a more important place
in our literature than do his radical admirers whose
fervent eulogy too often takes the form of the contention
that Poe was greater than this or that
American man of letters. His strong, sombre
genius saved the literature from any danger of
uniformity, relieved it at once and forever from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
the possible charge of colorlessness. That strangeness
of flavor which a late distinguished critic notes
as a mark of genius is imparted by Poe’s work to
our literary product as a whole. Here indeed was
‘the blossoming of the aloe.’</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Longfellows are descendants of William
Longfellow of Horsforth in Yorkshire, who
came to New England ‘about 1676,’ settled in
Newbury, and married Anne Sewall, a sister of
Samuel Sewall, the first chief-justice of Massachusetts.
‘Well educated but a little wild’ is one of
several illuminating phrases used to describe this
young Yorkshireman. He joined the expedition
against Quebec under Sir William Phipps (1690)
and perished in a wreck on the coast of Anticosti.
One of his sons, Stephen, a blacksmith, had a son
who was graduated at Harvard, became a schoolmaster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
in Falmouth (Portland), and held important
offices in the town government. His son, the
third Stephen, grandfather of the poet, was judge
of the court of common pleas, and representative
of his town in the legislature.</p>

<p>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was born at
Portland, in the District of Maine, on February
27, 1807. He was the second son of Stephen
Longfellow, a prominent lawyer, conspicuous in
political life, a member of the Massachusetts legislature,
and afterwards, when Maine acquired statehood,
a representative for his state in Congress. The
mother of the poet, Zilpah (Wadsworth) Longfellow,
was a daughter of General Peleg Wadsworth,
whose adventures during the Revolution bordered
on the romantic. Through the Wadsworths the
poet was a descendant of John Alden and Priscilla
Mullens.</p>

<p>At the age of thirteen Longfellow printed in
the Portland ‘Gazette’ his boyish rhymes on
‘The Battle of Lovell’s Pond.’ He studied at
private schools and at the Portland Academy, entered
Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, in the
Sophomore year, and was graduated in 1825, the
fourth in a class of thirty-eight. That he stood so
high seemed to him ‘rather a mystery.’ Before
leaving college he had begun contributing to the
‘United States Literary Gazette,’ a new bi-monthly,
published in Boston and edited by Theophilus
Parsons. In one year seventeen of his poems appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
in the ‘Gazette,’ for which payment was
made at the rate of two dollars a column. Five of
these early poems were reprinted in <i>Voices of the
Night</i>.</p>

<p>At the Commencement of 1825 the trustees of
Bowdoin had determined to establish a professorship
of modern languages. The chair was promised
Longfellow when he should have fitted himself for
it by study abroad. He sailed from New York in
May, 1826, provided by George Ticknor with
letters of introduction to Irving, Eichhorn, and
Southey. He travelled in France, Spain, Italy,
and Germany, mastered the Romance languages,
planned certain prose volumes, and announced to
his sister Elizabeth that his poetic career was finished.
In August, 1829, he was back in America.</p>

<p>His appointment being confirmed and the stipend
fixed at eight hundred dollars (together with
another hundred for services as college librarian),
Longfellow entered on his duties. During the next
five and a half years he corrected bad French and
Italian exercises, heard worse viva voce translations,
in brief, was a pedagogue in all homely and
trying senses of the word. With any one save a
born drill-master the class-room soon loses novelty.
In spite of the knowledge that he was useful
in a chosen field of work, more than happy in his
home-life (he had married, in 1831, Miss Mary
Storer Potter of Portland), Longfellow felt the
narrowness of his surroundings. Bowdoin was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
little college and Brunswick a village. The young
professor was ambitious. In his own phrase, he
wanted a stage on which he could ‘take longer
strides and speak to a larger audience.’ At one
time he thought of buying the Round Hill School,
and visited Northampton to look over the ground.
Fortune had something better in store for him.
Ticknor was about to resign the chair of modern
languages at Harvard, and proposed as his successor
Longfellow, whose translation of the <i>Coplas</i>
of Manrique (1833) had attracted his notice. The
position was formally offered and accepted; it
was understood that Longfellow was to spend a
year and a half in Europe before taking up his
work.</p>

<p>Accompanied by his young wife, Longfellow
crossed the ocean in April, 1835, and passed the
summer in Stockholm and Copenhagen, studying
the Scandinavian languages. In the autumn he
was in Holland. Mrs. Longfellow died the last
of November. Longfellow went to Heidelberg
for the winter, and to Switzerland and the Tyrol
for the spring and summer, and in December
(1836) was at Cambridge preparing his college
lectures.</p>

<p>He lodged at the famous colonial mansion in
Brattle Street known as Craigie House, in a room
that had once been Washington’s. When Longfellow
first applied, old Mrs. Craigie, deceived by
his youthful appearance, told him that she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
‘resolved to take no more students into the house.’
Craigie House passed into the possession of
Worcester, the lexicographer. Worcester sold it
to Nathan Appleton, whose daughter Longfellow
married in 1843. It then became the property of
Mrs. Longfellow.</p>

<p>At Harvard the exactions of work were not like
those in the smaller college, strictly pedagogical.
Longfellow had time for literature and for society.

<p>After eighteen years of service at Harvard,
Longfellow, in 1855, resigned his professorship,
handing over its responsibilities to a worthy successor,
James Russell Lowell. Released from
academic duties, he was able to give himself unreservedly
to literary work. Even in these new
conditions he enjoyed less freedom than would
be supposed. Longfellow had become a world-famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
poet and was compelled to pay in full
measure the penalties of fame. The demands on
his time were enormous. As his reputation increased
there was a proportionate increase in the
army of visitors which besieged his door. The
uniform kindness of their reception encouraged
hundreds more to come.</p>

<p>The beautiful serenity of Longfellow’s domestic
life was broken in upon by a frightful tragedy.
One July morning in 1861 Mrs. Longfellow’s
dress caught fire from a lighted match. It was
impossible to save her, and she died the following
day. The poet never recovered from the shock of
her death. How crushing the blow was may be
faintly conceived from that poem, ‘The Cross of
Snow,’ found among his papers after his death.</p>

<p>During the last quarter century of his life
Longfellow published the following books: <i>The
Courtship of Miles Standish</i>, 1858; <i>Tales of a
Wayside Inn</i>, 1863; <i>Flower-de-Luce</i>, 1867; <i>The
New England Tragedies</i>, 1868; <i>Dante’s Divine
Comedy, a Translation</i>,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> 1867–70; <i>The Divine Tragedy</i>,
1871; <i>Christus, a Mystery</i>, 1872;<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> <i>Three
Books of Song</i>, 1872; <i>Aftermath</i>, 1873; <i>The
Masque of Pandora</i>, and <i>Other Poems</i>, 1875;
<i>Poems of Places</i>, 1876–79 (edited); <i>Kéramos and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
Other Poems</i>, 1878; <i>Ultima Thule</i>, 1880. The
posthumous volumes were <i>In the Harbor</i>, 1882,
and <i>Michael Angelo</i>, 1884.</p>

<p>All the customary honors with which literary
achievement may be recognized were bestowed on
Longfellow. Some were formal and academic, scholastic
tributes to scholastic achievement. Others
were spontaneous and popular, an expression of
the heart. Two illustrations will suffice to show
the range of the poet’s influence. In 1869, during
Longfellow’s last journey in Europe, the degree
of D. C. L. was conferred on him by the University
of Oxford. In 1879, when the tree which
overhung ‘the village smithy’ was felled, an armchair
was made of the wood, and given to the poet
by the school-children of Cambridge. Both these
tributes were necessary. Each is the complement
of the other. Taken together, they symbolize the
characteristics of the man and the artist.</p>

<p>Of all American poets Longfellow reached the
widest audience. And it was with a feeling of
personal bereavement that every member of that
vast audience heard the news of his death at Cambridge,
on March 24, 1882.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_43">II<br />

<span class="subhead">LONGFELLOW’S CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">As</span> a young man Longfellow was pretty much
like other young men, fond of society and fond
of dress. At Cambridge the sober-minded were a
little disturbed by the brilliancy of his waistcoats.
In the Thirties it was permitted men, if they
would, to array themselves like birds of paradise.
Longfellow appears in some degree to have availed
himself of the privilege. After a visit to Dickens
in London in 1842 the novelist wrote Longfellow
that boot-maker, hosier, trousers-maker, and coat-cutter
had all been at the point of death. ‘The
medical gentlemen agreed that it was exhaustion
occasioned by early rising—to wait upon you at
those unholy hours!’ An English visitor who
saw Longfellow in 1850 thought him too fashionably
dressed with his ‘blue frock-coat of Parisian
cut, a handsome waistcoat, faultless pantaloons,
and primrose colored “kids.”’</p>

<p>In middle age his social instinct was as strong
as ever, but he cared less for ‘society.’ He restricted
himself to the companionship of his
friends, holding always in reserve time for his
dependants, of whom he had more than a fair
share.</p>

<p>Longfellow was large-hearted. He liked people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
if they were likable and sympathized with them
if they were unattractive or unfortunate. He was
open-handed, a liberal giver. Adventurers preyed
upon him. He endured them with patient strength.
When their exactions became outrageous, he made
an effort to be rid of them. If unsuccessful, he
laughed at his own want of skill and resigned
himself to be imposed on a little longer. A weaker
man would have sent these bores and parasites
about their business at once.</p>

<p>Incapable of giving pain to any living creature,
he could not understand the temper which
prompts another to do so. Fortunately the violence
or malignity of criticism had little effect on
him. He could even be amused by it. Of Margaret
Fuller’s ‘furious onslaught’ on him in the
‘New York Tribune,’ Longfellow said, ‘It is what
‘might be called a bilious attack.’</p>

<p>He disliked publicity whether in the form of
newspaper chronicle of his doings or recognition
in public places. He thought it absurd that because
Fechter had dined with him this unimportant
item must be telegraphed to Chicago and printed
in the morning journals. Fond as he was of the
theatre, he sometimes hesitated to go because of
the interest his presence excited. It was thought
extraordinary that he was willing to read his poem
‘Morituri Salutamus’ at the fiftieth anniversary
of his class at Bowdoin. He was delighted when
he found he was to stand behind the old-fashioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
high pulpit; ‘Let me cover myself as much as
possible. I wish it might be entirely.’</p>

<p>One trait of Longfellow’s character has been
over-emphasized—his gentleness. He was indeed
gentle; but continual harping on that string has
created the impression that he was gentle rather
than anything else. In consequence we have a
legendary Longfellow in whom all other traits of
character are subordinated to the one. His amiability,
his sense of justice, his entire freedom from
selfishness and vanity, and his genuine modesty,
which led him even when he was right and his
neighbor wrong to avoid giving needless pain by
intimating to the neighbor how wrong he was—all
contributed to hide the more forceful and emphatic
qualities. But the qualities were there.</p>

<p>Nothing is easier than to multiply illustrations
of this poet’s gracious traits of character. Holmes
epitomized all eulogy when he said of Longfellow:
‘His life was so exceptionally sweet and musical
that any voice of praise sounds almost like a discord
after it.’</p>

<h3 id="sec_44">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE POET</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Americans</span> sometimes disturb themselves needlessly
over the question whether Longfellow was
a great poet. It is absolutely of no importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
whether he was or was not. Of one thing they may
be sure,—he was a poet. Song was his natural
vehicle of expression. He had a masterly command
of technical difficulties of his art. Language became
pliant under his touch. Taking into account
the range of his metres, the uniform precision
with which he handled words, and the purity of
his style, Longfellow is eminent among American
poetical masters.</p>

<p>His sonnets are exquisite. His ballads, like
‘The Skeleton in Armor,’ have no little of the
fresh unstudied character which charms us in old
English ballad literature, a something not to be
traced to the spirit alone but to the technique as
well. The twenty-two poems of ‘The Saga of
King Olaf’ show an almost extraordinary metrical
power.</p>

<p>It must also be remembered that Longfellow
popularized for modern readers the so-called English
hexameter. <i>Evangeline</i> was a metrical triumph,
considering it wholly aside from the innate beauty
of the story or the artistic handling of the incidents.
The poet did not foresee his success. In
fact, as early as 1841, in the preface to his translation
of Tegnér’s <i>Children of the Lord’s Supper</i>,
Longfellow speaks of the ‘inexorable hexameter,
in which, it must be confessed, the motions of
the English muse are not unlike those of a prisoner
dancing to the music of his chains.’ But
here he was hampered by his theory of translation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
by his anxiety to render as literally as he could the
text of the original. When he took the matter into
his own hands and moulded the verse according
to his own artistic sense, it became another thing.
Wholly aside from the pleasure <i>Evangeline</i> has
given countless readers, it is something to have
broken down prejudice against the hexameter to
the extent of drawing out an indirect compliment
from Matthew Arnold, whose self-restraint in the
matter of giving praise was notorious.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> Scholars
have by no means withdrawn their opposition to the
English hexameter. That a more liberal temper
prevails is largely due to Longfellow.</p>

<p><i>Evangeline</i> had a stimulating effect on one English
poet of rare genius, Arthur Hugh Clough. A
reading of the Tale of Acadie immediately after a
reperusal of the <i>Iliad</i> led to the composition of
<i>The Bothie of Tober-na-Vuolich</i>.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>Another of Longfellow’s triumphs was so great
as to make it difficult for any one to follow him.
<i>Hiawatha</i> succeeded both because of the metre and
in spite of it. Any one can master this self-writing
jingle. ’Tis as easy as lying. One hardly knows
how facile newspaper parodists amused themselves
before they got <i>Hiawatha</i>. Holmes explained the
ease of the measure on physiological grounds.
We do not lisp in numbers, but breathe in them.
Did we but know it, we pass our lives in exhaling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
four-foot rhymeless trochaics.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> To write a poem
in the metre of the <i>Kalevala</i> still remains, with all
its specious fluency, an impossible performance for
any one not a poet. Thus Longfellow’s success had
a negative and restraining effect. He opened the
field to whoever cared to experiment with the
hexameter, but closed it, for the present at least,
to any rhythmical inventions calculated however
remotely to suggest the metre of his Indian edda.</p>

<h3 id="sec_45">IV<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>OUTRE-MER, HYPERION, KAVANAGH</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> most popular of American poets first challenged
public attention as a writer of prose. <i>Outre-Mer</i>
is a group of pieces after the manner of
Irving. <i>Hyperion</i> is a romance ‘in the old style,’
and shows the influence of Jean Paul Richter.
<i>Kavanagh</i>, published ten years after <i>Hyperion</i>, is a
novel.</p>

<p>Neither of the first two books is marked by a
buoyant Americanism. <i>Outre-Mer</i> does not, for
example, suggest <i>A Tramp Abroad</i>, and certainly
Paul Flemming is no kinsman of ‘Harris.’ In
other words, Europe was as yet too remote to be
made the subject of easy jest. Men did not ‘run
over’ to the Continent. The trip cost them dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
in time and money, and was not without the element
of anticipated danger. Travelling America
was unsophisticated and viewed the Old World
with childlike curiosity. Foreign lands were transfigured
in the romantic haze through which they
were seen.</p>

<p>The chapters of <i>Outre-Mer</i> were written by a
man too intoxicated with the charm of European
life to be annoyed by the petty irritations that
worry hardened tourists. Rouen, Paris, Auteuil,
Madrid, El Pardillo, Rome in midsummer, afford
the Pilgrim only delight. As in all books of the
kind there are interpolated stones, and in this book
interpolated literary essays. Every page betrays
the student and the lover of literature, who quotes
Jeremy Taylor and Sir Thomas Browne at Père la
Chaise, James Howell at Venice, and Shakespeare
everywhere.</p>

<p><i>Hyperion</i> is steeped in sentiment—almost in
sentimentality. Such a book could only have been
written when the heart was young. It is a mistake,
however, to read the volume as an autobiography;
the author objected to its being so read.
More important than the love story are the romantic
descriptions of the Rhine and the Swiss
Alps and the golden atmosphere enveloping it all.
Both these books have a common object, namely,
to interpret the Old World to the New.</p>

<p>When <i>Outre-Mer</i> was published an admirer
said that the author of <i>The Sketch Book</i> must look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
to his laurels. The praise implied was extravagant,
but not groundless. Longfellow’s prose has a
measure of the sweetness and urbanity which we
associate with Irving. Both writers are classic in
their serenity, and if highly artificial at times never
absurdly stilted. They often appear in old-fashioned
dress, but they wear the costume easily and
it becomes them. The modern reader, with a taste
dulled by high seasoning, marvels how the grandparents
could find pleasure in <i>Hyperion</i>. It would
be to the modern reader’s advantage to forswear
sack for a while and get himself into a condition to
enjoy what so greatly delighted the grandparents.</p>

<p>Besides a group of literary essays (published
in his collected works under the title of ‘Driftwood’)
Longfellow wrote a novel of New England
life, <i>Kavanagh</i>, which suffered by coming too
soon after <i>Evangeline</i>. It seems colorless when
placed beside the romantic tale of Acadie. Yet
one can well afford to take time to learn of Mr.
Pendexter’s griefs, and incidentally to become
acquainted with Billy Wilmerdings, who was turned
out of school for playing truant, and ‘promised his
mother, if she would not whip him, he would
experience religion.’ Hawthorne was enthusiastic
over <i>Kavanagh</i>; he, however, disclosed the
secret of its unpopularity when he said to Longfellow:
‘Nobody but yourself would dare to write
so quiet a book.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_46">V<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>VOICES OF THE NIGHT, BALLADS, SPANISH
STUDENT, BELFRY OF BRUGES, THE
SEASIDE AND THE FIRESIDE</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Longfellow</span> served the cause of his art in two
ways: first, he was an original poet, having a
genius which, if not profound, or brilliant, or massive,
or bewilderingly fresh and new, was eminently
poetical and eminently attractive; second,
he was an enthusiastic interpreter of the poetry of
other lands through the medium of trustworthy
and graceful translations.</p>

<p>In <i>Voices of the Night</i>, his earliest volume of
verse, the translations, from Manrique, Lope de
Vega, Dante, Charles d’Orléans, Klopstock, and
Uhland, outnumber the original pieces almost
two to one. Their characteristic is fidelity in spirit
and letter. They illustrate the genius of a poet
who found pleasure in giving wider audience to
the work of men he loved, and who did his utmost
to preserve the singular qualities of these
men.</p>

<p>Longfellow’s second volume, <i>Ballads and Other
Poems</i>, contains only four translations, but one of
them is Tegnér’s <i>Children of the Lord’s Supper</i>,
in three hundred and fifty hexameter verses. <i>The
Belfry of Bruges</i> contains a handful of translations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
from the German, including a lyric of Heine’s
done in a way to cause regret that Longfellow
did not put more of the <i>Buch der Lieder</i> into English.
In <i>The Seaside and the Fireside</i> is given entire
‘The Blind Girl of Castèl Cuillè’ by the barber-poet
Jasmin.</p>

<p>The translations bulk so large and are so plainly
a labor of love that it would seem as if Longfellow
regarded such work an important part of his poetic
mission. At the present time there is no need
to urge the translator to ‘aggrandize his office.’
He does so cheerfully. Sometimes it is done for
him. Are we not told that Fitzgerald was a greater
poet than Omar Khayyám? In 1840 the office
had not grown so great.</p>

<p>This interpretative work by no means ended
when Longfellow’s fame as a creative poet was at
its height and there was every incentive to build
for himself. When compiling (with Felton’s aid)
the <i>Poets and Poetry of Europe</i> he translated many
pieces for the volume. He gave years to reproducing
in English the majesty of Dante’s verse,
counting himself fortunate if his transcript, made
in all reverence and love, approached its great
original. This disinterestedness in the exercise
of his art is so greatly to his honor that praise
becomes impertinent. Catholic in his attitude
toward workers in the field of poesy, Longfellow
recognized the truth of the line</p>

<p class="center">
Many the songs, but song is one.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>Longfellow’s early verse had all the requisites
for popularity; it is clear, melodious, simple in its
lessons, tinged with sentiment and melancholy,
dashed with romantic color, and abounding in
phrases which catch the ear and pulsate in the
brain. The poet voices the longings, regrets, fears,
aspirations, the restlessness, or the faith, which go
to make up the warp and woof of everyday life.
An allegory, a moralized legend, a song, a meditation,
a ballad,—these are what we find in turning
the leaves of <i>Voices of the Night</i> or the <i>Ballads</i>.
Here is a certain popular quality not to be attained
by taking thought. ‘A Psalm of Life,’
‘Flowers,’ ‘The Beleaguered City,’ ‘The Village
Blacksmith,’ ‘The Rainy Day,’ ‘Maidenhood,’
‘Excelsior,’ ‘The Bridge,’ ‘The Day is Done,’
‘Resignation,’ ‘The Builders,’ are a few among
many illustrations of the type of verse which carried
Longfellow’s name into every home where poetry is
read. The range of emotions expressed is of the
simplest. There is feeling, but no thinking. The
robust reader who perchance has battened of late
on sturdy diet, like <i>Fifine at the Fair</i>, hardly knows
what to make of these poems, so little resistance
do they offer to the mind. The meaning lies on
the surface. But it is no less true that their essence
is poetical. The one thing never lacking is
the note of distinction. The human quality to
be found in such a poem as the ‘Footsteps of
Angels’ almost overpowers the poetic element.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
Nevertheless the poetry is there, and by virtue of
this Longfellow’s early work lives.</p>

<p>Other poems show his scholar’s love for the
past. They express the natural longing felt by
an inhabitant of a crude new land for countries
where romance lies thick because history is ancient.
‘The Belfry of Bruges’ and ‘Nuremberg’
are examples. Moreover Longfellow’s ballads
have genuine quality. ‘The Skeleton in Armor’
illustrates his study of Scandinavian literature.
‘The Wreck of the Hesperus’ is based on an
actual incident which came under his notice. The
criticism reflecting on this ballad because the poet
had never seen the reef of Norman’s Woe, is superfine.
Longfellow was born and reared almost
within a stone’s throw of the Atlantic. His knowledge
of the ocean began with his first lessons in
life. His sea poems are distinctive. ‘The Building
of the Ship,’ ‘The Fire of Driftwood,’ ‘Sir
Humphrey Gilbert,’ ‘The Secret of the Sea,’
‘The Lighthouse,’ ‘Chrysaor,’ and ‘Seaweed,’
whether or not they deserve the praise Henley
gives them, will always be accounted among Longfellow’s
characteristic pieces.</p>

<p>Two other works may be noted in this section:
the <i>Poems on Slavery</i> and a play, <i>The Spanish Student</i>.
The first of these, though academic, shows
how early Longfellow took his rank with the unpopular
minority. <i>The Spanish Student</i>, a play
based on <i>La Gitanilla</i> of Cervantes, was written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
<i>con amore</i>, and ‘with a celerity of which I did not
think myself capable.’ Longfellow had great
hopes of its success, though he seems not to have
been ambitious for a dramatic presentation. The
success was to come through the reader. <i>The
Spanish Student</i> shows that Longfellow could have
written good acting plays had he chosen to submit
to the irritations and rebuffs which are the
inevitable preliminary to dramatic good fortune.</p>

<h3 id="sec_47">VI<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>EVANGELINE, HIAWATHA, MILES
STANDISH, TALES OF A WAYSIDE INN</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><i>Evangeline</i> and <i>Hiawatha</i> mark the climax of
Longfellow’s contemporary popularity and may
be regarded as the principal bulwarks of his fame.
There is an anecdote to the effect that Hawthorne,
to whom the subject of Evangeline was proposed,
was not attracted by it, while Longfellow seized
on it eagerly. Such was the divergence of their
genius. Longfellow’s mind always sought the fair
uplands of thought, checkered with alternate sunshine
and shadow; it did not willingly traverse
deep ravines, gloomy and mysterious, or haunted
groves such as those about which Hawthorne’s
spirit loved to keep. The instinct which led the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
one poet to reject the narrative was as infallible as
that which led the other to appropriate it.</p>

<p>The tale of Acadie is engrossing in its very
nature, and whether told in prose or verse must
always invite, even chain, the attention. It is dramatic
without being melodramatic. The characters
are not mere ‘persons’ of the drama, they are types.
Evangeline will always stand for something more
than the figure of an unhappy Acadian girl bereft
of her lover. As Longfellow has painted her, she
is the incarnation of beauty, devotion, maidenly
pride, self-abnegation. So too of the other characters,
Gabriel, old Basil, Benedict; each has that
added strength which a character conceived dramatically
is bound to have if it shall prove typical
as well.</p>

<p>Longfellow gave himself little anxiety about the
historic difficulties of the Acadian question. It
was enough for him that these unhappy people
were carried away from their homes and that much
misery ensued. He painted the French Neutrals
as a romancer must. Father Felician was not
sketched from the Abbé Le Loutre, nor was life
in the actual Grand Pré altogether idyllic.</p>

<p><i>Evangeline</i> aroused interest in French-American
history. For example, Whewell wrote to Bancroft
to say that he feared Longfellow had some
historical basis for the story and to ask for information.</p>

<p>In the Plymouth idyl of the choleric little captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
who believed that the way to get a thing well
done was to do it one’s self, and who exemplified
his theory by having his secretary make a proposal
of marriage for him, Longfellow made one
of his most fortunate strokes. <i>The Courtship of
Miles Standish</i> showed the poetic possibilities in
the harsh, dry annals of early colonial life. The
wonder is that so few adventurers have cared to
follow the path indicated.</p>

<p>Bound up with the story of Priscilla and John
Alden is a handful of poems to which Longfellow
gave the collective title of ‘Birds of Passage.’
Here are several fine examples of his art: ‘The
Warden of the Cinque-Ports,’ ‘Haunted Houses,’
‘The Jewish Cemetery at Newport,’ ‘Oliver Basselin,’
‘Victor Galbraith,’ ‘My Lost Youth,’ ‘The
Discoverer of the North Cape,’ and ‘Sandalphon.’
It is a question whether in these eight poems we
have not a small but well-nigh perfect Longfellow
anthology. Certainly no selection of his writings
can pretend to be characteristic which does not
contain them.</p>

<p><i>Hiawatha</i> was not intended for a poetic commentary
on the manners and customs of the
North American Indians, though that impression
sometimes obtains. It is a free handling of Ojibway
legends drawn from Schoolcraft’s <i>Algic Researches</i>
and supplemented by other accounts of
Indian life. The grossness of the red man’s
character, his cruelty, his primitive views of cleanliness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
are wisely kept in the background, and his
noble and picturesque qualities brought to the
front. The psychology is extremely simple. This
Indian edda must be enjoyed for its atmosphere
of the forest, its childlike spirit, and its humor.
Hiawatha was a friend of animals (when he was
not their enemy), and understood them even better
than writers of modern nature-books. One
does not need to be young again to enjoy the account
of Hiawatha’s fishing in company with his
friend the squirrel. The sturgeon swallows them
both, and the squirrel helps Hiawatha get the
canoe crossways in the fish, a timely service in
recognition of which (after both have been rescued)
he receives the honorable name of Tail-in-air.
In fact, the poem abounds in observations of
animal life which as yet await the sanction of John
Burroughs.</p>

<p>Taking a series of poems on the half-real, half-mythical
King Olaf, adding thereto a group of
contrasting tales from Spanish, Italian, Jewish, and
American sources, assigning each narrative to an
appropriate character, binding the whole together
with an Introduction, Interludes, and a Conclusion,
Longfellow produced the genial <i>Tales of a
Wayside Inn</i>. The device of the poem is old, but
it can always be given a new turn. Adapted to
prose as well as verse, it may be used ‘in little,’
as Hardy has done in <i>A Few Crusted Characters</i>,
or in larger form, as in <i>A Group of Noble Dames</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<p>No secret was made of the fact that the ‘Wayside
Inn’ was the ‘Red Horse Inn’ of Sudbury,
Massachusetts, or that the characters, the Sicilian,
the Poet, the Student, the Spanish Jew, the Musician,
and the Theologian, were real people, friends
of Longfellow.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>The reader who takes up <i>Tales of a Wayside
Inn</i> knows by instinct that he may not look for
the broad and leisurely treatment, the wealth of
beauty and harmony, which characterize <i>The
Earthly Paradise</i> of Morris. That need not, however,
prevent him from enjoying the <i>Tales</i> on
quite sufficient grounds. The poems are often too
brief; some are mere anecdotes ‘finished just as
they are fairly begun.’ We are prepared for a
more generous treatment.</p>

<p>Though not written for that complex and formidable
entity ‘the child-mind,’ two poems in the
collection, ‘Paul Revere’s Ride’ and ‘King Robert
of Sicily,’ are beloved of school-children and dear
to the amateur elocutionist. The most original of
the tales is ‘The Saga of King Olaf,’ drawn from
the <i>Heimskringla</i>, and appropriately put into the
lips of the Musician. It is a poem redolent of the
sea and the forest. The theme was congenial to
Longfellow, who loved ‘the misty world of the
north, weird and wonderful.’</p>

<p>Prompted by the good fortune of <i>Tales of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
Wayside Inn</i>, the poet was led to make additions
to it. A second part appeared in <i>Three Books of
Song</i>, a third part in <i>Aftermath</i>. With these fifteen
additional tales the three parts were then collected
into a single volume.</p>

<h3 id="sec_48">VII<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>CHRISTUS, JUDAS MACCABÆUS, PANDORA,
MICHAEL ANGELO</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">As</span> early as 1841 Longfellow had conceived the
idea of an ‘elaborate poem ... the theme of
which would be the various aspects of Christendom
in the Apostolic, Middle, and Modern
Ages.’ In 1851 <i>The Golden Legend</i> appeared,
with no word to indicate that it was the second
part of a trilogy. Seventeen years more elapsed
and <i>The New England Tragedies</i> came from the
press, to be followed three years later by <i>The
Divine Tragedy</i>. The three parts were then arranged
in chronological order and the completed
work given the title of <i>Christus, a Mystery</i>.</p>

<p>One may guess why the first part of the trilogy
was the last to be published. A bard the most
indubitably inspired might question his power to
meet the infinite requirements of so lofty a theme.
Longfellow’s <i>Divine Tragedy</i> has received less than
due meed of praise. It has an austere beauty. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
a reader can be moved by the Scripture narrative,
he can scarcely remain unmoved by this reverent
handling of the story of the Christ. Through many
lines the poet follows the Scriptural version almost
to the letter, bending the text only enough to
throw it into metrical form. Often the dialogue
seems bald and the transitions abrupt because the
poet allows himself the least degree of liberty.
This severity and repression in the treatment are
one source of that power which <i>The Divine Tragedy</i>
certainly has.</p>

<p>Part two, <i>The Golden Legend</i>, is a retelling of
the story of Prince Henry of Hoheneck. Here,
Longfellow reproduces with skill the light and
color of mediæval life, if not its darkness and diablerie.
The street-preaching, the miracle-play in the
church, the revel of the monks at Hirschau, and
the lawless gayety of the pilgrims are all painted
with a clear and certain touch, but in colors almost
too pale, too delicate. Longfellow had not the
courage or the taste to handle these themes with
the touch of almost brutal realism they seem to
require.</p>

<p>The third part of the trilogy, <i>The New England
Tragedies</i>, consists of two plays, <i>John Endicott</i>
and <i>Giles Corey of the Salem Farms</i>, one dealing
with the persecution of the Quakers, the other
with the witchcraft delusion. The first is the better.
Edith Christison’s arraignment of Norton in
the church, her trial, punishment, her return to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
colony at the risk of her life, and the release of
the Quakers by the king’s mandamus, followed by
Endicott’s death, are vigorously depicted. The
character of the governor is finely drawn, and the
last scene between Bellingham and Endicott is a
strong and moving conception. As he bends over
the dead man, Bellingham <span class="locked">says:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">How placid and how quiet is his face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now that the struggle and the strife are ended!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Courageous heart! Forever rest in peace!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The companion play, <i>Giles Corey</i>, shows what
has been already observed, how little adapted
Longfellow’s genius was for dealing with psychological
mysteries. He could understand the mental
conditions and sympathize with persecutors and
victims, but he could not reproduce the uncanny
atmosphere enveloping the witchcraft tragedies.
<i>Giles Corey</i> is a finished study of a theme which
might have been developed into a powerful play.
It is profitable reading, yet if one would be carried
back into the horrors of that time he must go to
Hawthorne’s ‘Young Goodman Brown’ and not
to <i>Giles Corey</i>. Poets are notorious for taking
liberties with the facts of history. But according
to the late John Fiske, the poetical conception of
Cotton Mather as set forth in <i>The New England
Tragedies</i> is much nearer truth than the popular
conception of the great Puritan minister based on
the teachings of historians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

<p>The little five-act play, <i>Judas Maccabæus</i>, is a
piece of careful workmanship, like everything to
which Longfellow put his hand, and the scene between
Antiochus and Máhala rises into passionate
energy. <i>The Masque of Pandora</i> was more to
Longfellow’s taste, and if it does not satisfy the
classical scholar, who is proverbially hard to please,
it remains an attractive setting of one of the most
attractive of mythological stories.</p>

<p>The dramatic poem, <i>Michael Angelo</i>, though not
usually accounted Longfellow’s masterpiece, better
deserves that rank than certain more popular performances.
Besides being a lovely example of his
art, it is the expression of his maturest thought.
He kept it by him for years, working on it with
loving care, adding new scenes from time to time
and weighing critically the value of those already
written. Finally he put it to one side, and to show
that he had not entirely carried out his idea, the
words ‘A Fragment’ were subjoined to the title.
It was published after his death.</p>

<p><i>Michael Angelo</i> is not a play, but a series of
dramatic incidents from the life of the great sculptor,
illustrating his character, his thought, his work,
his friendships. Many passages display a strength
not commonly associated with Longfellow’s poetic
genius. Little is wanting to the delineation of
Michael Angelo to create the effect of massiveness.
From the first monologue where he sits in his
studio, musing over his picture of the ‘Last Judgment,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
to the midnight scene where Vasari finds
him working on the statue of the Dead Christ, the
effect is cumulative. The other characters are no
less skilfully wrought. Vittoria Colonna is a
beautiful conception, lofty yet human. Equally
attractive with a more earthly loveliness is Julia
Gonzaga, her friend, she to whom one to-day was
worth a thousand yesterdays. Titian, Cellini, the
Pope and his cardinals, Vasari, Sebastiano, the old
servant Urbino, and the aged monk at Monte
Luca effectively sustain the parts assigned them,
and unite to bring into always stronger relief the
character of the unique genius whom Longfellow
has made his central figure.</p>

<h3 id="sec_49">VIII<br />

<span class="subhead">LAST WORKS</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> translation of Dante was a difficult task to
which Longfellow gave himself for years with
something like consecration. It is satisfactory or
it is not, according to the point of view. He who
holds that verse can never be translated into verse,
and that a poem suffers least by being rendered in
prose, will make no exception in Longfellow’s
case. On the other hand, the reader who is not,
and who has neither the opportunity nor the
power to become a scholar in Italian, owes Longfellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
an inestimable debt of gratitude. The unpoetic
accuracy of which some complain counts
for a virtue. The translation remains, with all that
can be said against it, the work of a poet.</p>

<p>As age came on, Longfellow’s own verse, instead
of losing in charm, the rather increased.
<i>Kéramos</i>, <i>Ultima Thule</i>, and <i>In the Harbor</i> contain
many of his loveliest and most gracious poems.
‘Not to be tuneless in old age’ was his happy
fortune.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>His skill in the sentimental, homely, and obviously
moral has blinded not a few readers to
the larger aspects of Longfellow’s work. One
wearies, no doubt, of the ethical lesson that comes
with the inevitableness of fate. But there is no
need of impatience, Longfellow does not invariably
preach. Besides, all tastes must be taken into
account. Many prefer the ethical lesson, unmistakably
put.</p>

<p>Had Longfellow been more rugged, and had
he been content to end his poems now and then
with a question mark (figuratively speaking) instead
of a full stop, there would have been much
talk about the ‘depth of his meaning;’ and had
he been frankly suggestive on tabooed topics, we
should have heard a world of chatter about ‘the
largeness of his view’ and the surprising degree
in which he was in ‘advance of his time.’ Doubtless
he lacked brute strength. Whitman could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
have spared him a little of his own surplus, and
neither poet would have been the worse for the
transfer. Nevertheless Longfellow had abundance
of power exerted in his own way, which was not
the way of the world. What preposterous criticism
is that of Frederic Harrison, who characterizes
<i>Evangeline</i> as ‘goody-goody dribble’!</p>

<p>Perhaps Longfellow should be most praised
for his exquisite taste. He was refined to the finger-tips,
a gentleman not alone in every fibre of
his being but in every line of his work. The poet
of the fireside and the people was an aristocrat
after all. Generations of culture seem to be packed
into his verses. In a country where so much is
flamboyant, boastful, restless, and crude, the influence
of such a man is of the loftiest and most
benignant sort.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">John Greenleaf Whittier</span> was born at East
Haverhill, Massachusetts, on December 17,
1807. His father, John Whittier, a farmer, was
noted for probity, sound judgment, and great physical
strength. A man of few words, he always
spoke to the point, as when, in relation to public
charities with which he had officially to do, he said:
‘There are the Lord’s poor and the Devil’s poor;
there ought to be a distinction made between them
by the overseers of the poor.’ He had imperfect
sympathy with his son’s literary aspirations, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
were unjust to say that he was wholly opposed to
them.</p>

<p>Whatever lack there may have been on this
score was abundantly made up to the youth by his
beautiful and saintly mother. Abigail (Hussey)
Whittier was her husband’s junior by twenty-one
years. From her the poet inherited his brilliant
black eyes, a physical trait (mistakenly) supposed
to have been derived from the old colonial minister,
Stephen Bachiler, that enterprising and turbulent
spirit who came to America at the age of
seventy, founded cities, disputed the authority of
the clergy, and finally astonished friend and enemy
alike by marrying for the third time at the age of
eighty-nine.</p>

<p>Young Whittier was apparently destined to the
toilsome life of his farmer ancestors. He suffered
under the ‘toughening process’ to which New
England country lads were formerly subjected,
and became in consequence a lifelong valetudinarian.</p>

<p>With his frail physique and uncertain health the
‘Quaker Poet’ affords a marked contrast, not
alone to his own father, but to that mighty ancestor
Thomas Whittier, founder of the American
family, who at sixty-eight years of age was able to
do his share in hewing the oak timbers for a new
house in which he proposed to pass his declining
days. The building was erected about 1688.
Thomas Whittier enjoyed the use of it until his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
death in 1696. Five generations of Whittiers were
harbored beneath its roof, and here the poet was
born. Although not a Quaker himself, Thomas
Whittier was a friend of the Friends, and for taking
the part of certain unlicensed exhorters was for
a time deprived of his rights as a freeman.</p>

<p>Whittier was early a reader and soon devoured
the contents of his father’s slender library. So insatiable
was his thirst for books that he would walk
miles to borrow a volume of biography or travel.
At the age of fourteen he became fascinated with
the poems of Burns, and under their stimulus began
to make rhymes himself.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> On his first visit to
Boston he bought a copy of Shakespeare. Scott’s
novels he borrowed, to read them delightedly but
with a troubled conscience.</p>

<p>His poetic aspirations were encouraged by his
elder sister, Mary, who, without Whittier’s knowledge,
sent the verses entitled ‘The Exile’s Departure’
to the Newburyport ‘Free Press,’ a
short-lived journal edited by young William Lloyd
Garrison. They appeared in the issue of June 8,
1826. Whittier has described his emotions on first
seeing himself in print. The paper was thrown to
him by the news-carrier. ‘My uncle and I were
mending fences. I took up the sheet, and was
surprised and overjoyed to see my lines in the
“Poet’s Corner.” I stood gazing at them in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
wonder, and my uncle had to call me several times
to my work before I could recover myself.’</p>

<p>Other poems were offered and accepted. Curious
to see his contributor, Garrison drove over
from Newburyport to the Whittier farm. The
bashful country boy could with difficulty be persuaded
to meet his guest. Then began a lifelong
friendship not uncheckered by differences without
which friendship itself lacks zest.</p>

<p>Garrison urged on Whittier’s parents the importance
of giving the youth an education. Backed
up by the influence of A. W. Thayer, editor of the
Haverhill ‘Gazette,’ who offered to take the lad
into his own home, Whittier got his father’s consent
to his attending the newly established Haverhill
Academy. He paid for one term of six months
by making slippers, an art he learned from one of
the farm hands, and for another term by teaching
school, which seemed to him a less enviable mode
of life than cobbling.</p>

<p>The favor accorded his verse stimulated invention.
During 1827–28 he published, under assumed
names, nearly a hundred poems in the
Haverhill ‘Gazette’ alone. A plan for bringing
out a collection of these fugitive pieces under the
title of <i>Poems of Adrian</i> came, however, to nothing.</p>

<p>Garrison, who had been doing editorial work in
Boston for the Colliers, publishers of ‘The Philanthropist’
and ‘The American Manufacturer,’
advised their getting Whittier to take his place.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
Whittier edited the ‘Manufacturer’ from January
to August, 1829, when he was summoned home by
the illness of his father. But he had had a taste of
journalism and politics, and relished both. From
January to July, 1830, he edited the Haverhill
‘Gazette.’ His newspaper work made him acquainted
with George Prentice of ‘The New England
Review,’ published in Hartford. When
Prentice left Connecticut for Kentucky, where he
was to spend six months and write a campaign life
of Henry Clay, he urged the owners of the ‘Review’
to engage Whittier as his substitute. Whittier
was responsible for the conduct of the paper
for a year and a half (July, 1830, to January, 1832).
In spite of many drawbacks, his father’s death, his
own illness, a disappointment in love, the period
of his Hartford residence was the happiest and the
most stimulating he had yet known. He printed
his first volume, <i>Legends of New England</i>, a medley
of prose and verse, edited <i>The Literary Remains of
John G. C. Brainard</i> (the sketch of Brainard’s life
prefixed to the volume throws much light on
Whittier’s reading), and brought out the narrative
poem <i>Moll Pitcher</i>, a story of the once famous
‘Lynn Pythoness.’</p>

<p>On his return to Haverhill he played his part
in local politics and was talked of for Congress.
Somewhat later he was drawn into the anti-slavery
movement and for the next twenty-seven years
this was his life. He was a member of the legislature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
in 1835, and was reëlected the next year; but
in general terms it may be said that in publishing
<i>Justice and Expediency</i>, and in uniting himself
with the small, unpopular, and exasperating party
of Abolitionists, he sacrificed hope of political
advancement. He gave to the cause time, health,
reputation, and when he had it to give, money. In
company with Abolitionist leaders and orators he
encountered mobs and speculated philosophically
on the chance of losing his life.</p>

<p>In 1837 he acted as a secretary to the American
Anti-Slavery Society in New York. From 1838
to 1840 he edited ‘The Pennsylvania Freeman,’
published in Philadelphia. During an Abolitionist
convention, Pennsylvania Hall, in which were
the offices of the ‘Freeman,’ was sacked and
burned by a pro-slavery mob. Whittier, disguised
in a wig and a long overcoat, mingled with the
rioters and contrived to save a few of his papers.
It was a more dangerous rabble than that he encountered
during the George Thomson riot at
Concord, New Hampshire, three years earlier.
Whittier once remarked that he never really
feared for his life, but that he had no mind to a
coat of tar and feathers.</p>

<p>A true son of Essex, he soon wearied of city
life. ‘I would rather live an obscure New England
farmer,’ he said. ‘I would rather see the
sunset light streaming through the valley of the
Merrimac than to look out for many months<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
upon brick walls, and Sam Weller’s “werry beautiful
landscape of chimney-pots.”’</p>

<p>He really had no choice in the matter, having
been warned to give up editorial work if he would
keep his precarious hold on life. He obeyed the
warning. But with Whittier journalism was a disease.
He had a relapse in 1844, when he took
charge of the ‘Middlesex Standard’ of Lowell,
and again, in 1845–46, when he was virtual editor
of the ‘Essex Transcript’ in Amesbury.</p>

<p>No restriction was placed on his doing work at
home. He wrote unceasingly, prose and verse,
reaching his literary audience through the ‘Democratic
Review’ and his audience of reformers
through Bailey’s paper, ‘The National Era,’ both
published in Washington. Whittier was corresponding
editor of the ‘Era’ from 1847 to 1850,
and printed in its columns, besides political articles,
such now famous poems as ‘Maud Muller,’
‘Ichabod,’ ‘Tauler,’ and ‘The Chapel of the
Hermits.’</p>

<p>The list of Whittier’s chief publications up to
the year 1857 contains seventeen titles: <i>Legends
of New England</i>, 1831; <i>Moll Pitcher</i>, 1832 (revised
edition 1840); <i>Justice and Expediency</i>, 1833;
<i>Mogg Megone</i>, 1836; <i>Poems written during the
Progress of the Abolition Question</i>, etc., 1837
(unauthorized issue); <i>Poems</i>, 1838; <i>Lays of my
Home and Other Poems</i>, 1843; <i>The Stranger in
Lowell</i>, 1845; <i>Voices of Freedom</i>, 1846; <i>The Supernaturalism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
of New England</i>, 1847; <i>Leaves from
Margaret Smith’s Journal</i>, 1849; <i>Poems</i>, 1849;<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
<i>Old Portraits and Modern Sketches</i>, 1850; <i>Songs
of Labor and Other Poems</i>, 1850; <i>The Chapel of
the Hermits and Other Poems</i>, 1853; <i>Literary
Recreations and Miscellanies</i>, 1854; <i>The Panorama
and Other Poems</i>, 1856.</p>

<p>The founding of the ‘Atlantic Monthly’ (1857)
gave Whittier a more assured place. His work
was sought and the pay was generous. He became
an overseer of Harvard College in 1858.
In 1860 the college made him a Master of Arts,
and in 1866 a Doctor of Laws.</p>

<p>His home for many years was in Amesbury,
the farm at East Haverhill having been sold in
1836. After the death of his mother and younger
sister he passed much of his time with kinsfolk at
the house known as ‘Oak Knoll,’ in Danvers.
For all his admiration of women, Whittier never
married. He enjoyed allusions to a supposititious
Mrs. Whittier. Writing to his niece, Mrs. Pickard,
about some friend who was unhappy over
political defeat, Whittier said: ‘I told him I had
been in the same predicament ... and got abused
worse than he did, for I was charged with ill-treating
my wife!’</p>

<p>Whittier was a birthright member of the Society
of Friends and influential in their councils.
His advice was much sought and freely given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
in terms of blended modesty, good sense, and
humor.</p>

<p>During the last twenty years of his life Whittier
published the following volumes: <i>Home Ballads
and Poems</i>, 1860; <i>In War Time and Other Poems</i>,
1864; <i>National Lyrics</i>, 1865; <i>Snow-Bound</i>, 1866;
<i>The Tent on the Beach and Other Poems</i>, 1867;
<i>Among the Hills and Other Poems</i>, 1869; <i>Ballads
of New England</i>, 1870; <i>Miriam and Other Poems</i>,
1871; <i>The Pennsylvania Pilgrim and Other Poems</i>,
1872; <i>Mabel Martin</i>, 1874; <i>Hazel-Blossoms</i>, 1875;
<i>The Vision of Echard and Other Poems</i>, 1878; <i>The
King’s Missive and Other Poems</i>, 1881; <i>The Bay
of Seven Islands and Other Poems</i>, 1883; <i>Saint
Gregory’s Guest and Recent Poems</i>, 1886; <i>At Sundown</i>,
1892.</p>

<p>The honors accorded him on his seventieth,
eightieth, and eighty-fourth anniversaries gave
Whittier much happiness. He was especially
pleased to learn that the bells of St. Boniface, in
Winnipeg, Manitoba (celebrated in his ‘Red River
Voyageur’), were rung for him at midnight of
December 17, 1891. Said the poet in his letter to
Archbishop Tâché: ‘Such a delicate and beautiful
tribute has deeply moved me. I shall never forget
it.’</p>

<p>Nothing was left undone that the tenderest love
and wisest solicitude could do for his comfort.
His last illness was brief. He died at Hampton
Falls, New Hampshire, on September 7, 1892.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_51">II<br />

<span class="subhead">WHITTIER’S CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Whittier’s</span> shyness was proverbial. Those who
knew him also knew that beneath that shyness was
a masterful spirit. Evasion and inconclusiveness
on the part of those with whom he dealt would
not avail. Whittier wanted to know where public
men stood and for what they stood. A politician
himself, he understood the art of dealing with politicians.
To a certain candidate he said: ‘Thee
cannot expect the votes of our people unless thee
speak more plainly.’ Being in great need of the
votes of ‘our people,’ the candidate was compelled
to speak at once and to use the words Whittier put
into his mouth.</p>

<p>Another possessed of like skill in controlling
men might have grown despotic. Not so Whittier.
Tactful and conciliatory, no grain of selfishness
was to be found in his composition. He worked
for the cause alone.</p>

<p>His physical courage, of which there are abundant
illustrations, was fully equal to his moral courage.
The nerve required to face a disciplined
enemy, as in war, is always admirable; one would
not wish to underestimate it. But it is a type of
courage not difficult to comprehend. A glamour
hangs about the battlefield. Men are carried on by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
the esprit de corps. They do wonders and marvel
at their own courage afterwards. Facing a mob is
another matter. A mob is an assassin; the last
thing it wants is fair play. Whittier had no experiences
like those to which Bailey and Garrison
were subjected, but he had enough to try his mettle.</p>

<p>He was one of the most modest of men, holding
his achievements, literary and otherwise, at far
lower estimate than did the public. To an anxious
inquirer Whittier said that he did not think ‘Maud
Muller’ worth serious analysis. He asked for criticism
on his verses, and was not slow to act upon
it when given. His open-mindedness is shown in
the way he accepted Lowell’s suggestion about the
refrain of ‘Skipper Ireson’s Ride.’ He defended
himself when the criticism touched his motives or
impugned his love of truth. Charged with having
boasted that his story of ‘Barbara Frietchie’ would
live until it got beyond reach of correction, Whittier
replied: ‘Those who know me will bear
witness that I am not in the habit of boasting of
anything whatever, least of all of congratulating
myself upon a doubtful statement outliving the
possibility of correction.... I have no pride of
authorship to interfere with my allegiance to truth.’</p>

<p>He was a stanch friend, and a helpful neighbor.
His filial piety was deep—no trait of his character
was more pronounced. He was the most devoted
of sons, the best of brothers.</p>

<p>The seriousness of Whittier’s temper and mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
was relieved by a keen sense of humor which found
expression in many engaging ways. His letters
written in young manhood are at times almost
boisterously mirthful. His humor grew subdued
as he became older, but it never lost its charm.
Those who were nearest him realized how much
it contributed to making him the most companionable
of men.</p>

<h3 id="sec_52">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE LITERARY CRAFTSMAN</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">‘I have</span> left one bad rhyme ... to preserve
my well known character in that respect,’ says
Whittier in a letter to Fields, his publisher. The
charge of laxity in rhymes was the one most often
brought against him. He labored under two capital
disadvantages; he was self-taught and he wrote
always for a moral purpose. His objection to reprinting
<i>Mogg Megone</i> grew out of the feeling, not
that it was bad poetry,—though he had no delusions
about its artistic value,—but that it was not
calculated to do good. Ethics, rather than art,
were uppermost in his thought. There has never
been question of his native power. He could be
exquisitely felicitous, but, having acquired the
habit of writing for a cause, of sacrificing nicety of
phrase for vigor of thought and rapidity of utterance,
being eager always to strike a blow at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
critical moment, he found it difficult to write with
a dominant artistic motive. He wrote better (technically
speaking) the older he grew. It is difficult
to realize as we listen to the rich strains of his
later years that Whittier could have been as inharmonious
as he often was in the first period of
his poetic life. He confessed his defect. To Fields
he once said: ‘It’s lucky that other folks’ ears
are not so sensitive as thine.’</p>

<p>His variety of metres, if not great, was sufficiently
ample to preclude the feeling of sameness.
His verse never comes laden with scholarly suggestion
in rhythm or thought, with the faint sweet
echoes of old-time poetry, as does Longfellow’s.
Whittier was not ‘literary,’ though he made a
noble addition to the literature of his country.</p>

<p>Whittier’s prose has been ignored rather than
underestimated. It is clear and forceful, often impassioned,
and sometimes eloquent. Whether a
reputation could be based on it is another matter.
Certainly it has not been accorded the popular favor
it deserves. Among a thousand readers, for example,
who know <i>Snow-Bound</i> there are possibly two
or three who have read <i>Margaret Smith’s Journal</i>.</p>

<p>Of the seven prose sketches in <i>Legends of New
England</i> not one was thought by the author worth
preserving. He also suppressed much of the contents
of the two volumes published some fifteen
years after the <i>Legends</i>. Both these later books,
<i>The Stranger in Lowell</i> and <i>The Supernaturalism of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
New England</i>, ought to be reprinted as they came
first from Whittier’s hand.</p>

<p><i>The Stranger in Lowell</i>, a volume of more or
less related essays, is in part a record of impressions
made on the author during a brief residence
in the new manufacturing town by the Merrimac.
The extraordinary growth of ‘The City of a Day’
was then, and is still, a legitimate cause for wonder.
All the eighteen papers are readable, and that
entitled ‘The Yankee Zincali’ is a little classic.
Whittier’s next volume of prose, <i>The Supernaturalism
of New England</i>, consists of nine chapters
on witches, wizards, ghosts, apparitions, haunted
houses, charms, and the like. It is rather a wide
survey of the subject, from the Indian powahs to
the Irish Presbyterians who settled in New Hampshire
in 1720, and brought with them, ‘among
other strange matters, potatoes and fairies.’ Whittier
dwells on these traditions of his country with
deep interest and sets them forth with no little
humor. It is a fault of the book that he does not
dwell on them at greater length.</p>

<p><i>Leaves from Margaret Smith’s Journal</i> is an admirable
study of colonial New England in 1678.
The style is sweet, the narrative flowing, the characters,
many of them historical, are consistent and
lifelike, and the tone of delicate irony running
through the book is most engaging. Genuinely
illuminating to the student of manners are such
passages in the journal as those describing the ordination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
of Mr. Brock at Reading, the meeting
at the inn with a son of Mr. Increase Mather, ‘a
pert talkative lad’ abounding in anecdotes of the
miraculous, the antics of Mr. Corbet’s negro boy
Sam, and the encounter on the way back to Boston
with the good old deacon under the influence of
flip. A strong and engrossing plot might have
made the book more popular, as it might also have
been inconsistent with the artlessness of what purports
to be a young girl’s journal.</p>

<p><i>Old Portraits and Modern Sketches</i> is a volume
of character studies of ancient worthies (such as
Bunyan, Ellwood, Baxter, Marvell) and of two or
three moderns (like William Leggett, to whom
Whittier pays a generous tribute). <i>Literary Recreations
and Miscellanies</i> consists of a reprint of material
used in earlier books, together with a group
of reviews and other papers.</p>

<span class="subhead">NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY VERSE</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Whittier’s</span> instinct drew him irresistibly to native
themes. He believed that the American poet
should write about America. ‘New England is full
of Romance,’ he had said in his sketch of Brainard.
‘The great forest which our fathers penetrated—the
red men—their struggle and their disappearance—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
Powwow and the War-dance—the
savage inroad and the English sally—the tale
of superstition, and the scenes of Witchcraft,—all
these are rich materials of poetry.’ And it
is safe to assume that Whittier never questioned
the wisdom of his own choice of subjects, though
he was often dissatisfied with the treatment.</p>

<p>Much of Whittier’s early verse died a natural
death. More ought in his opinion to have done
so. He marvelled at the ‘feline tenacity of life’
exhibited by certain poems and thought it flat contradiction
of the theory of the survival of the fittest.
He destroyed every copy of <i>Legends of New
England</i> that he could get his hands on. He
would have been glad to suppress <i>Mogg Megone</i>.
‘Is there no way to lay the ghosts of unlucky
rhymes?’ he asked, when the question was raised
of reprinting the story in the ‘blue and gold’ volumes
of 1857. It had appeared in the first collected
edition (1849), and again in 1870; but when
the definitive edition was published (1888), <i>Mogg
Megone</i> was consigned to ‘the limbo of an appendix,’
and printed in type small enough to make
the reading a torture.</p>

<p>The plot is imaginary, but the characters are for
the most part historical. The outlaw Bonython
sells his daughter to the Saco chief Hegone, or, as
he was commonly called, Mogg Megone. The
girl murders the savage as he lies drunk in her
father’s hut. For Mogg had boasted of killing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
her seducer. She flies to the settlement of the
Norridgewock Indians to confess to the Jesuit
Sebastian Ralle, and is repulsed by the angry
priest, whose plans are thwarted by Megone’s untimely
death. Wandering about in agony, she sees
the attack by the English on Norridgewock, when
Ralle was shot at the foot of the cross, and later
is found by Castine and his men, dead in the
forest. The poem is spirited and abounds in incident,
but it is melodramatic. It lacks the magic
of Whittier’s art. Nevertheless he unjustly depreciated
it.</p>

<p>A better performance is ‘The Bridal of Pennacook,’
with its strongly marked characters of
Passaconaway, Weetamoo, and Winnepurkit, its
contrasting pictures of the rich Merrimac valley
and the wild Saugus marshes. Along with this
story of Indian life may be read ‘The Fountain’
and the musical stanzas of the ‘Funeral Tree of
the Sokokis.’ ‘The Truce of Piscataqua’ and
‘Nauhaught, the Deacon’ are later poems illustrating
Indian character.</p>

<p>Living in what had been for many years one
of the border towns of Massachusetts, Whittier
was naturally drawn to themes, partly historic,
partly legendary, touching the struggles between
French, English, and Indians. ‘Pentucket’ commemorates
Hertel de Rouville’s night attack on
Haverhill. ‘St. John,’ a ballad of Acadia, describes
the sack of La Tour’s fortress by his rival,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
D’Aulnay. ‘Mary Garvin’ and ‘The Ranger’
are ‘border’ ballads.</p>

<p>Now and then he rhymes ‘a wild and wondrous
story,’ such as ‘The Garrison of Cape Ann,’
which he found in the <span class="locked"><i>Magnalia Christi</i>:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Dear to me these far, faint glimpses of the dual life of old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inward, grand with awe and reverence; outward, mean and coarse and cold;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gleams of mystic beauty playing over dull and vulgar clay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Golden-threaded fancies weaving in a web of hodden gray.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A number of the poems turn on the witchcraft
persecutions: ‘Mabel Martin,’ ‘The Witch of
Wenham,’ and the fine ‘Prophecy of Samuel
Sewall.’ In <i>The Tent on the Beach</i> are two more:
‘The Wreck of the Rivermouth’ and ‘The
Changeling.’</p>

<p>Whittier was always ready to speak on the injustice
of injustice. His Quaker ancestors used to
receive gifts of forty stripes save one. They were
martyrs for the cause of religious liberty. And the
sufferings of the New England Quakers was a subject
always to the poet’s hand. He contemplated
the wrongs that had been righted and was grateful
therefor; but it was a part of his mission to
teach his readers what progress had been made
since the days in which state and church united
to persecute a harmless if sometimes extravagant
people. The lesson may be found in such poems
as ‘How the Women went from Dover’ and ‘The
King’s Missive.’ Whittier knew that injustice is
always ridiculous, and a grim humor plays at times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
about his treatment of events in that dreadful day,
as in the story of Thomas Macy. The most characteristic
setting of his general theme is to be found
in the spirited ballad of ‘Cassandra Southwick.’
The incident is told dramatically by the heroine herself,
but the passion which glows through the verse
is true Whittier.</p>

<h3 id="sec_54">V<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>VOICES OF FREEDOM</i>, <i>SONGS OF LABOR</i>,
<i>IN WAR TIME</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> militant note in Whittier’s verse was sounded
early. In 1832, when he was twenty-five years
old, he wrote the stanzas ‘To William Lloyd
Garrison.’ They were followed by ‘Toussaint
L’Ouverture’ (1833), ‘The Slave-Ships’ (1834),
‘The Hunters of Men’ and ‘Stanzas for the
Times’ (1835), ‘Clerical Oppressors’ (1836),
and the stinging ‘Pastoral Letter’ (1837). He
was now fairly embarked on his mission.</p>

<p>The brunt of his attack fell on supine Northern
politicians, clerical apologists, and anxious
business men who feared agitation might injure
their Southern trade. Nothing was more abhorrent
to Whittier than traffic in human flesh. He
marvelled that it was not abhorrent to every one,
and strove with all his power to make it so.
America, in his belief, was a by-word among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
nations, forever prating of ‘liberty’ while she
bought and sold slaves.</p>

<p>As he was the assailant of timid vote-seekers,
money-getters, and ministers who defended slavery
‘on scriptural grounds,’ so was Whittier the eulogist
of all who made sacrifices for the cause, or
who, like ‘Randolph of Roanoke,’ a man with
every traditional motive to cling to the peculiar
institution, testified against it. <i>Voices of Freedom</i>
is a record of the guerilla warfare which Whittier
waged during forty years against slavery. With
the additions he made to it in the progress of the
struggle, it became not only the largest division of
his work but one of the most notable. The history
of Abolitionism is written here. ‘The Pastoral
Letter’ was Whittier’s response to the body
of Congregational ministers who deprecated the
discussion of slavery as tending to make trouble
in the churches. ‘Massachusetts to Virginia’ was
called out by Latimer’s case. ‘Texas,’ ‘Faneuil
Hall,’ and the lines ‘To a Southern Statesman’
are a protest against the annexation of territory
‘sufficient for six new slave states.’ ‘For Righteousness’
Sake’ was inscribed to friends ‘under
arrest for treason against the slave power.’ The
fine closing stanza deserves to be better <span class="locked">known:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">God’s ways seem dark, but, soon or late,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They touch the shining hills of day;</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">The safe appeal of Truth to Time!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘The Kansas Emigrants’ celebrates the Western
advance, the coming of the new Pilgrims,
armed with the Bible and free schools. ‘Le Marais
du Cygne’ was written on hearing of the
Kansas massacre in May, 1858. ‘The Quakers
are Out,’ a campaign song (not included in the
collected writings), celebrates the Republican victory
in Pennsylvania on the eve of the National
<span class="locked">election:—</span></p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Away with misgiving—away with all doubt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Lincoln goes in, when the Quakers are out!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Not the least notable among these poems is
‘The Summons,’ in which the poet contrasts the
quiet of summer with the distant tumult of approaching
war, and his knowledge of his place in
the approaching struggle with consciousness of
his inability to act.</p>

<p>The Voices of Freedom are often harsh and
discordant. Lines were written in hot haste
and sent to press before the ink had time to dry.
The needs of the moment were imperative.
There was little time to correct and no time to
polish. Had Whittier possessed a lyric gift approximating
that of Hugo or Swinburne, how
wonderful must have been his contribution to our
literature. For the cause was great and his devotion
single. Much of the verse, however, is journalism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p>He rises easily to poetic heights. ‘Massachusetts
to Virginia’ has a magnificent swing and
pulsates with passion. When Webster’s defection
spread anger, consternation, and grief through the
ranks of the party of Freedom, Whittier penned
the burning stanzas to which he gave the title
‘Ichabod.’ This anti-slavery poem was published
in <i>Songs of Labor</i>, and is justly accounted one of
the loftiest expressions of Whittier’s genius.</p>

<p><i>In War Time and Other Poems</i> records the anxieties,
fears, hopes, and exultations incident to the
great conflict between North and South. Says the
<span class="locked">poet:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">‘... our voices take</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sober tone; our very household songs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are heavy with a nation’s griefs and wrongs;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And innocent mirth is chastened for the sake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the brave hearts that nevermore shall beat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The eyes that smile no more, the unreturning feet!’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The volume contains ‘Barbara Frietchie,’ perhaps
the most popular ballad of the war, based on
an incident told to Whittier by Mrs. Southworth,
the novelist. One must reconstruct the times to
comprehend the extraordinary effect produced by
this dramatic little incident. Iconoclasts have made
havoc with the story. If their points are well taken,
we have one proof more of the superiority of legend
over history for poetic purposes. Other noteworthy
poems in this volume are ‘Thy Will be
Done’ and the magnificent hymn ‘Ein Feste Burg
ist Unser Gott.’</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>SNOW-BOUND</i>, <i>TENT ON THE BEACH</i>,
<i>PENNSYLVANIA PILGRIM</i>, <i>VISION OF
ECHARD</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> volume of 1860, <i>Home Ballads and Poems</i>,
contained two perfect examples of Whittier’s art,
namely, ‘My Playmate’ and ‘Telling the Bees.’
To inquire what far-off experiences in the poet’s life
prompted the making of these exquisite ‘ballads,’
as Whittier called them, were idle, poets being
proverbially given to the use of the imagination.
The music of the dark pines on Ramoth Hill
could be no sweeter than it is. The theme of either
poem is common enough among bards, and perennially
attractive. ‘My Playmate’ and ‘Telling
the Bees,’ together with ‘Amy Wentworth’ and
‘The Countess,’ all show, though in varying degrees,
how pregnant with poetic suggestion were
the scenes amid which Whittier passed his life.
Even that urban and aristocratic little poem
‘Amy Wentworth’ derives half its charm from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
the world of associations called up by the fog
wreaths, the pebbled beach, and the sweet brier
blooming on Kittery-side.</p>

<p>The above-named poems, together with ‘The
Barefoot Boy’ and ‘In School-Days,’ suggest
a phase of Whittier’s genius which found complete
expression in the ‘winter idyl,’ a picture of life in
the old East Haverhill homestead.</p>

<p><i>Snow-Bound</i> was published in 1866. What the
author thought of it we now know: ‘If it were not
mine I should call it pretty good.’ The public
decided for itself and bought copies enough to
fatten Whittier’s lean purse with ten thousand
dollars. The enviously-inclined should remember
that the poet was nearly sixty when this happened
to him. A twelvemonth later <i>The Tent on the Beach</i>
was published and began selling at the rate of a
thousand copies a day. Whittier wrote to Fields:
‘This will never do; the swindle is awful; Barnum
is a saint to us.’</p>

<p>Readers who find difficulty in comprehending
the enthusiasm that <i>Snow-Bound</i> evoked must reflect
that there are strange creatures in the world
who actually like winter. For them Whittier had
a particular message. He has reproduced the atmosphere
of the New England landscape under
storm-cloud and falling snow with utmost precision.
No important detail is wanting, and no
detail is emphasized to the injury of the general
effect. The exactness and simplicity of the touch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
are wholly admirable. The result is as exquisite
as the means to it are unostentatious.</p>

<p><i>Snow-Bound</i> is a favorite because of its homely,
sweet realism, because of the poetic glow thrown
on old-fashioned scenes, because of the variety of
moods (which, lying between the extremes of playfulness
and deepest feeling, shade naturally from
one to the next); and because of the reverential
spirit, the high confidence and trust. The poem
is autobiographical, but it needs no ‘key’ to give
it interest. The characters are types.</p>

<p>In <i>The Tent on the Beach</i> it is related how a
poet,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> a publisher (who in this instance, contrary
to the traditions of his race, is a friend of the poet),
and a traveller beguile an evening at the seaside
with the reading of manuscript verses from the
publisher’s portfolio. The tales, eleven in number,
with a closing lyric on ‘The Worship of Nature,’
are too uniformly sombre. The one called ‘The
Maids of Attitash’ is blithe enough, but the gray
tints need even more relief.</p>

<p>Whittier’s power in descriptions of sea and sky
is displayed at its best in this volume. One does
not soon forget this stanza from the <span class="locked">prelude:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sometimes a cloud, with thunder black,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Stooped low upon the darkening main,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Piercing the waves along its track</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With the slant javelins of rain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when west-wind and sunshine warm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chased out to sea its wrecks of storm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They saw the prismy hues in thin spray showers</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the green buds of waves burst into white froth-flowers!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even better is the description of the breakers
seen by <span class="locked">twilight:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">... trampling up the sloping sand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In lines outreaching far and wide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The white-maned billows swept to land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dim seen across the gathering shade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A vast and ghostly cavalcade.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The change from the mist and confusion of the
brief tempest to the clear after effect was never
better <span class="locked">rendered:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Suddenly seaward swept the squall;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The low sun smote through cloudy rack;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Shoals stood clear in the light, and all</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The trend of the coast lay hard and black.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Among the Hills</i>, <i>Miriam</i>, and <i>The Pennsylvania
Pilgrim</i> come next in order of publication. The
first is a romance of New England country life;
the second is ‘Oriental and purely fiction;’ the
third, partly historical and partly imaginative, is
an attempt to reconstruct life in Penn’s colony
towards the close of the Seventeenth Century.
Whittier said of <i>The Pennsylvania Pilgrim</i>: ‘It is
as long as <i>Snow-Bound</i>, and better, but nobody
will find it out.’ The poet felt that too little had
been said in praise of the humanizing influences
at work in the colonies by the Schuylkill and the
Delaware. The Pilgrim Father here celebrated is
Daniel Pastorius, who planted the settlement of
Germantown. He was the first American abolitionist.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
The poem abounds in happy pictures of
scenery, and in tenderly humorous sketches of
the quaint characters who found peace, shelter, and,
above all, toleration, under the beneficent rule of
Pastorius.</p>

<p><i>The Vision of Echard</i> will serve to introduce
Whittier’s distinctively religious poems. A characteristic
performance, it admirably illustrates his
manner, diction, cast of thought. First, the scenes
of great natural beauty, where historical memories
are overlaid and blended with ideas of ceremonial
pomp associated with formal religion; and then,
projected on this rich background, the dreamer
and his dream. The blended walls of sapphire
in Echard’s vision ‘blazed with the thought of
<span class="locked">God:’—</span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>
<p>Whittier did not include ‘The Preacher’ among
his religious poems. This fine picture of the ‘great
awakening’ might be so classified. Also ‘The
Chapel of the Hermits,’ ‘Tauler,’ and yet others.
In general the religious poems consist of meditations
on sacred characters and scenes, poetic settings
of Biblical narrative, and reflective poems in
which Whittier gives voice to phases of his spiritual
life, and above all to a faith so broad that the
distinctions of sect and creed are lost in its catholic
charity. ‘Questions of Life,’ ‘The Over-Heart,’
‘Trinitas,’ ‘The Shadow and the Light,’
and ‘The Eternal Goodness’ are the expressions
of this lofty and inspiring side of his poetic genius.</p>

<p>Whittier’s singing voice lost none of its flexibility
but rather gained as time went on. ‘The
Henchman’ was a striking performance for a
man of seventy. ‘It is not exactly a Quakerly
piece, nor is it didactic, and it has no moral that
I know of,’ observed Whittier. He must have
known that it had the moral of exquisite beauty.
Indeed he admitted that it was ‘not unpoetical.’</p>

<p>His last utterance was a little group of poems,
<i>At Sundown</i>, having for the controlling thought
the close of life’s day. One of them, ‘Burning
Drift-Wood,’ was the poet’s farewell; and with
the quotation of four of its stanzas we may bring
to an end this brief survey of Whittier’s work.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Among</span> the passengers in the ship which
brought Winthrop and Dudley to the New
World was William Hathorne, the ancestor of the
novelist. A man of character, versatile, naturally
eloquent, and a born leader, he rose to a position
of influence in the colony. One of his sons, John
Hathorne, was destined to sinister renown as a
judge at the trials for witchcraft held at Salem in
1691.</p>

<p>Daniel Hathorne, a grandson of the old witch
judge, took to the sea, and during the Revolutionary
War served as a privateersman. He had
seven children. Nathaniel, his third son, also a
sea-captain, married Elizabeth Clarke Manning,
and became the father of Nathaniel Hawthorne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
the novelist, who was born at Salem, Massachusetts,
on July 4, 1804.</p>

<p>Captain Hawthorne died at Surinam in 1808.
The rigid seclusion in which his widow lived after
her husband’s death had a marked effect on her
son, quickening his sensibilities and at the same
time clouding his lively nature with a shadow of
premature gravity.</p>

<p>Hawthorne’s boyhood was passed partly at
Salem, partly on the shores of Sebago Lake, in
Maine, where his grandfather Manning owned
large tracts of land. His reading for pleasure included
Clarendon and Froissart, to say nothing of
that old-time boys’ delight, the Newgate Calendar.
The first book that he bought with his own money
was Spenser’s <i>Faery Queen</i>. At sixteen he had
read <i>Caleb Williams</i>, <i>St. Leon</i>, and <i>Mandeville</i>. ‘I
admire Godwin’s novels and intend to read all of
them.’</p>

<p>He entered Bowdoin College in the same class
with Longfellow and Franklin Pierce, and was
graduated in 1825. For the next twelve years he
lived the life of a recluse in his own home at Salem,
indulging his passion for writing and for taking
twilight walks. It was the period of his literary
apprenticeship. Later he was, as he says, ‘drawn
somewhat into the world and became pretty much
like other people.’ In 1828 he published, anonymously
and at his own expense, a novel, <i>Fanshawe</i>.
He made some mystery about it, binding by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
solemn promises the few who were in the secret
of the authorship, not to betray it. The public was
indifferent to the book, and Hawthorne afterwards
destroyed the copies he could find. His early
sketches and stories were published in annuals
such as ‘The Token,’ and in periodicals such as
‘The New England Magazine,’ ‘Knickerbocker,’
and ‘The Democratic Review.’ For the most
part they ‘passed without notice.’</p>

<p>In 1837 appeared a volume of eighteen of these
sketches and stories, to which Hawthorne gave
the title of <i>Twice-Told Tales</i>. An enlarged edition,
containing twenty-one additional stories, appeared
in 1842. Between the two, Hawthorne brought
out a group of children’s stories, <i>Grandfather’s
Chair</i>, <i>Famous Old People</i>, and the <i>Liberty Tree</i>,
all in 1841, and <i>Biographical Stories for Children</i>,
1842.</p>

<p>When Bancroft became Collector of the Port of
Boston, he appointed Hawthorne as weigher and
gauger (1839). Thrown out by the change of administration
(1841), Hawthorne invested his savings
in the Brook Farm enterprise. This move
(described by his latest biographer as ‘the only
apparently freakish action of his life’) was made
in the hope of providing a home for his betrothed,
Sophia Peabody. He threw himself with good
humor into the life of the community, planted
potatoes, cut straw, milked three cows night and
morning, and signed his letters to his sister ‘Nath.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
Hawthorne, Ploughman.’ Reports circulated that
the author of the <i>Twice-Told Tales</i> might be seen
dressed in a farmer’s frock, carrying milk to Boston
every morning; also that he was ‘to do the travelling
in Europe <i>for the Community</i>.’</p>

<p>Brook Farm proved ‘thralldom and weariness,’
and Hawthorne abandoned it, losing, as he later
discovered, the one thousand dollars he had invested.
In July, 1842, he married and settled in
the ‘Old Manse’ at Concord.</p>

<p>He had now enough and to spare of the leisure
which a deliberate writer finds indispensable. In
a room overlooking the battlefield (the room in
which Emerson had written <i>Nature</i>) Hawthorne
penned many of the tales afterwards incorporated
in <i>Mosses from an Old Manse</i>. The period of his
residence at Concord will always seem to those
who have studied its many charming records not
undeserving the characterization of idyllic. It was
brought to a close in 1845, when there seemed a
likelihood (made a certainty the following year) of
his becoming Surveyor of Customs for the Port
of Salem. Hawthorne held this post until June,
1849. His removal gave him time for the working
out of an idea that had possessed him for many
months, and which took shape in the form of his
great romance, <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>.</p>

<p>From the spring of 1850 to the autumn of
1851 Hawthorne lived at Lenox in the Berkshire
Hills, and there wrote <i>The House of the Seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
Gables</i>. He then removed to West Newton, where,
during the winter of 1851–52, he wrote <i>The Blithedale
Romance</i>. In June, 1852, he took possession
of a house in Concord, which he had bought of
Alcott. He had but fairly settled himself in his
new home (‘The Wayside’ he called it) when his
friend Franklin Pierce, now President of the United
States, made him consul at Liverpool.</p>

<p>Hawthorne assumed his charge in July, 1853,
and conducted its affairs with energy and skill until
September, 1857. The period of his English
residence was rich in experiences, of which social
honors formed the least part. The quiet, brooding
observer had no wish to be lionized and apparently
discouraged the few well-meant advances
that were made. He once saw Tennyson at the
Arts’ Exhibition at Manchester, and rejoiced in
him more than in all the other wonders of the
place; but it was like Hawthorne to have been
content merely to gaze at the laureate without presuming
on his own achievements as ground for
claiming acquaintance.</p>

<p>After leaving Liverpool, Hawthorne spent two
winters in Italy, where <i>The Marble Faun</i> was conceived.
The greater part of the actual writing was
done in England, at Redcar on the North Sea.</p>

<p>At this point it will be well to take note of
Hawthorne’s principal writings subsequent to the
publication of the second edition of the <i>Twice-Told
Tales</i>. They are: <i>The Celestial Railroad</i>, 1843;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
<i>Mosses from an Old Manse</i>, 1846;<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> <i>The Scarlet
Letter</i>, 1850; <i>The House of the Seven Gables</i>, 1851;
<i>A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys</i>, 1852; <i>The
Snow-Image, and Other Twice-Told Tales</i>, 1852;
<i>The Blithedale Romance</i>, 1852; <i>Life of Franklin
Pierce</i>, 1852; <i>Tanglewood Tales</i>, 1853; <i>The Marble
Faun, or the Romance of Monte Beni</i>, 1860;<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
<i>Our Old Home</i>, 1863.</p>

<p>The posthumous publications are: <i>Passages
from the American Note-Books of Nathaniel Hawthorne</i>,
1868; <i>Passages from the English Note-Books</i>
..., 1870; <i>Passages from the French and
Italian Note-Books</i> ..., 1872; <i>Septimius Felton</i>,
1872; <i>The Dolliver Romance</i>, 1876; <i>Doctor Grimshawe’s
Secret</i>, 1883.</p>

<p>In June, 1860, after an absence of seven years,
Hawthorne returned to ‘The Wayside.’ He felt
the burden of the political situation now culminating
in civil war. With little sympathy for the
cause of Abolition, Hawthorne, when the conflict
had actually begun, found it ‘delightful to share
in the heroic sentiment of the time’ and to feel
that he had a country.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

<p>His health began to decline and he was spiritless
and depressed. In March, 1864, accompanied
by his friend W. D. Ticknor, he started southward,
hoping for benefit from the change. Ticknor,
who was seemingly in perfect health, died
suddenly in Philadelphia. Hawthorne was unnerved
by the shock. In May he undertook a
carriage journey among the New Hampshire hills
with Pierce. The friends proceeded by easy stages,
reaching Plymouth in the evening of May 18.
Hawthorne was growing visibly weaker and Pierce
had already determined that he would send for
Mrs. Hawthorne. Shortly after midnight he went
into his friend’s room. Hawthorne was apparently
sleeping. He went again between three and four
in the morning. Hawthorne was dead.</p>

<h3 id="sec_57">II<br />

<span class="subhead">HAWTHORNE’s CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">‘I am</span> a man, and between man and man there
is always an insuperable gulf,’ said Kenyon in
<i>The Marble Faun</i>.</p>

<p>Hawthorne might have been speaking through
Kenyon’s lips, so accurately does the saying voice
his private thought. He lived in a world apart.
No experience of custom-house, consulate, or farm
could bring him quite out of his world into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
common world of men. Hawthorne had more
reason than Emerson to complain of the wall between
him and his fellow-mortals. When glib
talkers were displaying no end of conversational
change, Hawthorne kept his hands in his pockets.
He had no mind to indulge in that form of matching
pennies known as small talk.</p>

<p>Observers have voiced their impressions of him
in different ways; their testimony is not discordant.
The romantically inclined described Hawthorne
as mysterious. Plain people thought him queer.
Even his brother authors found him odd. Longfellow
described Hawthorne as ‘a strange owl, a
very peculiar individual, with a dash of originality
about him very pleasant to behold.’ Yet Hawthorne
was without a grain of affectation, and took
keen interest in the homely facts of life. His
books everywhere betray this interest. He who
wrote that description of his kitchen garden in
<i>The Old Manse</i> would seem to be just the man to
lean over the fence and talk cabbages and squashes
with some neighborhood farmer. And perhaps he
did.</p>

<p>He was not fond of men of letters as a class—which
is not surprising. The friends who stood
close to him were not literary. Bridge was a naval
officer. Pierce was a politician, representative of
a type for which Hawthorne had contempt. Hillard
was a lawyer, a man of the world.</p>

<p>Hawthorne was not without his share of ‘human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
nature,’ as we say. He had his prejudices, and
they were sometimes deeply rooted. When smarting
under a sense of injustice he could wield a
caustic pen. He was a good hater, but not narrow-minded.
He hated spirit-rapping, table-tipping,
and all the vulgar machinery and manifestations
of a vulgar delusion. He hated noise, brawling,
and dissension. He loved his home. His
letters to his wife reveal a nature of exquisite
delicacy. He loved children, Nature, and he was
chivalrous in his attitude towards the animal
creation.</p>

<p>A trait of Hawthorne’s character comes out
in the following incident. He proposed to dedicate
<i>Our Old Home</i> to Franklin Pierce. This was
in 1863. The publishers, it is said, were filled with
‘consternation and distress.’ The ex-president’s
name was not one to conjure with. Hawthorne
explained his position: ‘I find that it would be a
piece of poltroonery in me to withdraw either the
dedication or the dedicatory letter.... If Pierce
is so exceedingly unpopular that his name is
enough to sink the volume, there is so much the
more need that an old friend should stand by
him. I cannot, merely on account of pecuniary
profit or literary reputation, go back from what
I have deliberately felt and thought it right to
do.... As for the literary public, it must accept
my book precisely as I see fit to give it, or
let it alone.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span></p>

<p>Friendship sometimes has in it an element of
perversity, and has been known to delight in petty
martyrdom. There was nothing of this in Hawthorne.
All he notes is that friendship is not a
commodity.</p>

<h3 id="sec_58">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WRITER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Hawthorne</span> knew the secret of producing magical
effects by quiet means. He had perfect command
of the materials by which are rendered the
half tones, the delicate shadings, the mysterious
opalescent hues of beautiful prose. Yet his manner
is unostentatious and his vocabulary simple.
There are writers in whose work the feeling excited
of pleasurable surprise can be traced to a
particular word glittering like a diamond or a sapphire.
With Hawthorne the effects are elusive,
not always to be apprehended at the moment.</p>

<p>The beauty of his prose is best explained by the
beauty of the ideas; the natural phrasing serves
but to define it, as physical loveliness may be accentuated
by simplicity of dress. Hawthorne’s
thoughts, being exquisite in themselves, make
ornament superfluous.</p>

<p>There is no trace of effort in his writing. <i>The
Scarlet Letter</i>, for example, reads as if it had come
‘like a breath of inspiration.’ Such directness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
precision of touch must always be a source of wonder
and delight, not alone to writers who fumble
their sentences but to skilled literary craftsmen as
well. In Henry James’s admirable story ‘The
Death of the Lion’<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> is a paragraph which suggests
Hawthorne’s manner. The regal way in which
the famous novelist, Neil Paraday, adds perfect
sentence to perfect sentence is altogether like
Hawthorne.</p>

<p>Economy of phrase is one of his virtues. In
Hawthorne there are no wasted or superfluous
sentences, not even a word in excess. Something
inexorably logical enters into his work, as in the
poetic art. This economy extends to his books
as a whole. For stories so rich in ideas, so heavy
with suggestion, they are short rather than long.
Yet the movement is always leisurely. There is
no haste or eagerness. A few strokes of the pen,
made with restful deliberation, serve to carry the
reader into the very heart of a tragedy. He cannot
but admire the superb strength which with so
little visible effort could bring him so far.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SHORT STORIES</span>

<span class="subhead"><i>TWICE-TOLD TALES</i>, <i>MOSSES FROM AN OLD
MANSE</i>, <i>THE SNOW-IMAGE</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Hawthorne’s</span> real entrance into literature dates
from the publication of the <i>Twice-Told Tales</i>, a
series of harmoniously framed narratives which
have maintained their rank unmoved by the capriciousness
of popular taste.</p>

<p>The sources are in part colonial history or historical
legend and tradition. ‘The Gray Champion’
is an incident of the tyranny of Andros.
‘The Maypole of Merry Mount’ celebrates the
madcap revelries of the first settlers at Wollaston.
In ‘Endicott and the Red Cross’ Hawthorne
records a dramatic incident in the history of his
native town, and introduces, by the way, a motive
that later was to develop into his masterpiece.</p>

<p>The ‘Legends of the Province House’ (‘Howe’s
Masquerade,’ ‘Edward Randolph’s Portrait,’
‘Lady Eleanore’s Mantle,’ and ‘Old Esther Dudley’)
have their warp of historical truth, but the
imaginative element is dominant. ‘The Gentle
Boy’ is Hawthorne’s sympathetic tribute to the
persecuted sect of the Quakers. ‘Sunday at Home,’
‘Snow-Flakes,’ ‘Sights from a Steeple,’ ‘Footprints<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
on the Seashore,’ represent a type of literature
which former generations enjoyed, and
which modern magazine editors would decline
with energy and quite perfunctory thanks.</p>

<p>There are stories of horror and psychological
mystery. The author of ‘Markheim’ might have
chosen a theme like that treated in ‘Wakefield,’
or in ‘The Prophetic Pictures.’ His handling
would have been different. We do not gladly
suffer an obvious moral in these days. No one
would now dare to put ‘A Parable’ for the explanatory
title of his narrative, as Hawthorne has
done in ‘The Minister’s Black Veil,’ or advise the
reader that the experiences of David Swan (if experiences
those can be called where a man sleeps
and things <i>do not</i> happen to him) argue ‘a superintending
Providence.’</p>

<p>In <i>Mosses from an Old Manse</i> Hawthorne’s
gain in power is marked. He still ‘moralizes’
his legends; but the force of the conception and
the richness of the imagery drive the philosophy
into the background. The grim and uncanny
humor of which Hawthorne had a masterful command
is displayed to the full in this book. No
better illustration can be cited than the scene
where the old witch Mother Rigby exhorts the
scarecrow, she had so cunningly fashioned, to be a
man. It is a grotesque, a gruesome, and a mirth-provoking
scene.</p>

<p>Hawthorne had brooded long over the superstitious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
past with which his own history was so
singularly linked. Among the fruit of these meditations
was the story of ‘Young Goodman Brown.’
Like the minister in the fearful narrative of ‘Thrawn
Janet,’ Goodman Brown had been in the presence
of the powers of evil; but unlike the minister, he
no longer believed in virtue.</p>

<p><i>Mosses from an Old Manse</i> also includes odd
conceits such as ‘The Celestial Railroad,’ a new
enterprise built from the famous City of Destruction,
a ‘populous and flourishing town,’ to the
Celestial City. The dreamer in this modern Pilgrim’s
Progress takes the journey under the personal
conduct of Mr. Smooth-it-away and notes
with interest the improvements in methods of
transportation since Bunyan’s time. Less ingenious
but no less amusing are ‘The Hall of Fantasy,’
‘The Procession of Life,’ and ‘The Intelligence
Office.’ Monsieur de l’Aubépine loved an allegorical
meaning.</p>

<p>Between the <i>Twice-Told Tales</i> and the <i>Mosses</i>
Hawthorne published a group of children’s stories.
<i>Grandfather’s Chair</i> and the two succeeding volumes
consist of little narratives of colonial history,
in which our national exploits are celebrated
in the tone of confident Americanism so much
deplored by Professor Goldwin Smith. There
are ‘asides’ for grown people, as when Grandfather
tells the children that Harvard College was
founded to rear up pious and learned ministers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
and that old writers called it ‘a school of the
prophets.’</p>

<p>‘Is the college a school of the prophets now?’
asked Charley.</p>

<p>‘You must ask some of the recent graduates,’
answered Grandfather.</p>

<p>The <i>Wonder-Book</i> and its sequel, the <i>Tanglewood
Tales</i>, contain new versions of old classical myths,
the Gorgon’s Head, the Minotaur, the Golden
Fleece, and nine more. Here the adult reader has
a chance to feel the magic of Hawthorne’s art in
a form where it seems most tangible but is no less
elusive. He will be astonished at the air of reality
given these old legends.</p>

<p>The perfect example of his work in this genre
(the child’s story) is the initial fantasy of <i>The
Snow-Image, and Other Twice-Told Tales</i>. Such
complete interweaving of the imaginative and the
realistic is little short of marvellous. And yet
there are people who say that perfect art cannot
subsist in company with a moral. They may be
commended to the account of the common-sensible
man who in the goodness of his heart brought
the odd, glittering, little snow-fairy into the house
and put her down in front of the hot stove.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE GREAT ROMANCES</span>

<span class="subhead"><i>SCARLET LETTER</i>, <i>HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES</i>,
<i>BLITHEDALE ROMANCE</i>, <i>MARBLE FAUN</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">In</span> addition to being an engrossing narrative and
in every way a supreme illustration of Hawthorne’s
art, <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> is a study in will power.
Of the four human lives involved in this tragedy,
that of Hester Prynne is the most absorbing, as
her character is the loftiest. Carried to the place
of shame, her dark Oriental beauty irradiates all
about her, and she bears herself like a queen.
Her punishment is her own, she will ask none
to share it. Her sacrifice has been infinite, but
it asks nothing in return. She bears with regal
patience slight and insult, and that worst punishment
of all, the wondering terror of little children,
who flee her approach as of an evil thing.</p>

<p>Hawthorne has brought out with infinite skill
the dreariness of the years following the public
disgrace when Hester has no longer the help of a
rebellious pride such as carried her almost exultantly
through the first crises of the dungeon and
the pillory. With a refinement of art the author
adds one last bitter drop to Hester Prynne’s cup
of bitterness in the wasting away of her superb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
beauty. But as the lines of her face hardened and
the natural and external graces disappeared, the
great soul waxed greater, more capable of love and
pity and tenderness. She became a ministering
angel whose coming was looked for as if she had
indeed been sent from Heaven.</p>

<p>It was a singular fancy of Hawthorne’s to give
Hester a child like Pearl, precocious, fitful, enigmatic,
a will-o’-the-wisp, more akin to the ‘good
people’ of legendary lore than to the offspring
of human men and women. This too was a part
of Hester’s discipline, that this <i>un</i>-human, elf-like
creature should have sprung from her, with a power
transcending that of other children to mix pain
with pleasure in a mother’s life.</p>

<p>Looking at Roger Chillingworth as he appears
in his ordinary life, one sees only the wise, benevolent
physician, infinitely solicitous for the welfare
of his young friend Arthur Dimmesdale. Surprise
him when the mask of deep-thoughted benevolence
is for the moment laid aside and it is the
face of a demon that one beholds.</p>

<p>Without a grain of pity for his victim he probes
the minister’s soul. Morbidly eager, he welcomes
every sign that makes for his theory of a hidden,
a mental rather than a physical sickness. He
gloats with malignant joy over the discovery that
this spiritually minded youth has inherited a strong
animal nature. Here is a deep and resistless undercurrent
of passion which has led to certain results.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
An unflinching and cruel analysis will make clear
what those results have been. Suspicion becomes
certainty, but proof is still wanting.</p>

<p>For terrible suggestiveness there are but few
scenes in American fiction comparable with that
where Chillingworth bends over the sleeping minister
in his study and puts aside the garment that
always closely covered his breast. The poor victim
shuddered and slightly stirred. ‘After a brief
pause, the physician turned away. But with what
a wild look of wonder, joy, and horror! With
what a ghastly rapture, as it were, too mighty to
be expressed only by the eye and features, and
therefore bursting through the whole ugliness of
his figure, and making itself even riotously manifest
by the extravagant gestures with which he
threw up his arms towards the ceiling, and stamped
his foot upon the floor! Thus Satan might have
comported himself when a precious human soul
is lost to heaven and won into his kingdom. But
what distinguished the physician’s ecstasy from
Satan’s was the trait of wonder in it!’</p>

<p>Dimmesdale is the deeply pathetic figure in this
tragedy of souls. Seven years of hypocrisy might
well bring the unhappy man to the pitiable condition
in which he is found when the lines of interest
in the story draw to a focus. Day by day,
month by month, his was a life of lies. No course
of action seemed open to the wretched minister
which did not involve piling higher the mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
of falsehood. To lie and to scourge himself for
lying—this was his whole existence. We praise
Hester Prynne’s courage. Not less extraordinary
was Dimmesdale’s wonderful display of will power.
A weaker man would have confessed at once, or
fled, or committed suicide. The minister may not
be accused of stubbornly holding to his course
from fear. He feared but one thing: the shock
to the great cause for which he stood, the shame
that the revelation of his guilt would bring upon
the church, the loss of his power to do good, the
spectacle, for the eyes of mocking unbelievers, of
the ‘full-fraught man and best indued’ proved the
guiltiest. This were indeed ‘another fall of man.’</p>

<p>Incomparable as <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> undoubtedly
is, there are admirers of Hawthorne’s genius who
have pronounced <i>The House of the Seven Gables</i> the
better story of the two. The judgment may be
erroneous, it is at least not eccentric.</p>

<p>In handling the genealogical details of the
first chapter, Hawthorne showed a deft touch.
The descendants of the proud old Colonel
Pyncheon are as clearly defined as if the name and
station of each had been enumerated. With no
less ease does one follow the fortunes of the
humble house of Matthew Maule. This progenitor
of an obscure race had been executed for witchcraft.
All of his descendants bore the stamp of
this event. They were ‘marked out from other
men.’ In spite of an exterior of good fellowship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
there was a circle about the Maules, and no man
had ever stepped foot inside of it. Unfortunate
in its early history, this family was never other
than unfortunate. It had an inheritance of sombre
recollections, which it brooded upon, though unresentfully.</p>

<p>Its life was linked with that of the proud house
whose visible mansion was founded on property
wrested from the old martyr to superstition. For
Colonel Pyncheon had shown acrimonious zeal in
the witchcraft persecutions, and unbecoming speed
in seizing on the wizard’s little plot of ground with
its spring of soft and pleasant water. Inseparable as
substance and shadow, wherever there was a Pyncheon
there was also a Maule. An endless chain
of dark events depended from that crime of witchcraft
days. On the scaffold the condemned wizard
prophesied concerning his accuser: ‘God will give
him blood to drink.’ Men shook their heads
when Colonel Pyncheon built the House of the
Seven Gables, on the site of Matthew Maule’s
hut. They had not long to wait for the fulfilment
of the prophecy. The spring became bitter, and
on the day when the stately dwelling was first
opened to guests Colonel Pyncheon was found
dead in his study, with blood-bedabbled ruff and
beard. Against this tragedy of old colonial days
as a background Hawthorne projects the later story
of <i>The House of the Seven Gables</i>.</p>

<p>In its simplest aspect the narrative concerns the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
persecution of an unfortunate and weak representative
of the Pyncheon family by a powerful and
unscrupulous representative. At intervals through
the centuries the spirit of the great Puritan ancestor
made its appearance in the flesh, as if the
Colonel ‘had been gifted with a sort of intermittent
immortality.’ Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon stands
as a modern reincarnation of the old persecutor
of witches. Clifford, his cousin, is a victim of the
law at one of those moments when the law seems
to operate almost automatically. Suspected of
murder, he might have been cleared had Jaffrey
but told what he knew, the real manner of their
uncle’s death. This were to disclose certain of his
own moral delinquencies, and Jaffrey keeps silent.
And thus it happens that, both being in their
young manhood, the one is incarcerated and the
other enters on a path leading to influence, wealth,
and good repute.</p>

<p>To the ‘somber dignity of an inherited curse’
the Pyncheons added yet another dignity in the
form of a shadowy claim to an almost princely
tract of land in the North. The connecting link,
some parchment signed with Indian hieroglyphics,
had been lost when the Colonel died; but the
poorest of his race felt an accession of pride as he
contemplated that possible inheritance. And the
richest of modern Pyncheons, the Judge, was not
proof against ambitious dreams excited by the same
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<p>Affecting to believe that Clifford knows where
the lost document is hidden, the Judge tries to
force himself on his victim, who, made almost an
imbecile by long imprisonment, is now, after his
release, harbored in the House of the Seven
Gables and cared for by his aged sister Hepzibah
and his fair young cousin Phœbe. And while the
Judge is waiting, watch in hand, for the terror-stricken
Clifford to come to him, Death comes instead.
Maule’s curse is fulfilled in yet another
generation. The suspicion that would have fallen
anew on Clifford is averted by Holgrave. But
Holgrave, as he chooses to call himself, is the last
living representative of the family of Maule the
wizard. And it was for one of the persecuted race
to save the unhappiest member of the family by
which his own had suffered. Holgrave marries
Phœbe Pyncheon and the blood of the two families
is united.</p>

<p>Holgrave’s sole inheritance from his wizard ancestor,
as he laughingly explained, was a knowledge
of the hiding-place of the now worthless
Indian deed. For this secret a Pyncheon had bartered
his daughter’s life and happiness in former
years.</p>

<p>The Judge Pyncheon of the story has been pronounced
‘somewhat of a stage villain, a puppet.’
This may possibly be due less to Hawthorne’s
handling of the character than to the inherent
weakness of the hypocrite as presented in fiction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
or drama. The patrician old woman turned shop-keeper
is so perfect a study that praise of the delineation
is almost an impertinence. And there is
the great silent but living and breathing House
of the Seven Gables, in the creation of which Hawthorne
expended the wealth of his powers. It will
always be a question whether in the spiritual significance
he attaches to or draws from some physical
fact this great literary artist does not show his
highest power. And many a time one finishes the
reading of this particular book with the feeling
that the House of the Seven Gables is the real
protagonist of the drama.</p>

<p>In respect that it is a beautiful example of Hawthorne’s
art <i>The Blithedale Romance</i> is deserving of
all the praise lavished upon it; in respect that it is
a picture of Brook Farm it is naught. The author
himself freely admitted that he chose the socialist
community merely as a theatre where the
creatures of his brain might ‘play their phantas-magorical
antics’ without their being exposed to
the rigid test of ‘too close a comparison with the
actual events of real lives.’</p>

<p>The antics played are such as we witness daily
when human puppets are swayed by various passions
of love, jealousy, self-will, pride, humility,
the instinct for art, or the instinct for reform.
The bearded Hollingsworth, whose ‘dark shaggy
face looked really beautiful with its expression of
thoughtful benevolence,’ was, without being conscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
of it, a brutal egoist, capable of bending all
people and all things to the accomplishment of
his idea. He illustrates the weakness of strength,
as Priscilla, so frail, nervous, and impressionable,
illustrates the strength of weakness.</p>

<p>That Hawthorne intended to show in Coverdale
the insufficiency of the profession of minor
poet to make anything of a man, we shall not pretend;
but his distrust of the worth of literature is
well known. Coverdale’s failure was no greater
than Hollingsworth’s, and he at least never played
with hearts.</p>

<p>Zenobia is at once the most human, the most
attractive, and the most pathetic figure in the
drama. ‘But yet a woman,’ and too much woman,
so that her imperial beauty and grace, her wealth,
her skill to command, her magnetic charm, and
her intellectual gifts were insufficient to save her.
No less regal in endowment than was Hester
Prynne, she sank under a burden infinitely lighter
than Hester’s. Her nature was strong but impulsive,
and impulsiveness was Zenobia’s ruin.</p>

<p>Rome is the scene of <i>The Marble Faun</i>, the longest
of Hawthorne’s romances, and in his opinion
the best. The author professed to have seen, in
the studio of an American sculptor, Kenyon, an
unfinished portrait bust, certain traits of which
led him to ask the history of the original. This
face, of a beautiful youth, might have been mistaken
for a not fortunate attempt to reproduce the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
roguish countenance of the Faun of Praxiteles.
The resemblance was external merely; the beholder
presently detected something inscrutable
in the eyes, in the whole expression, as if powers of
the soul hitherto dormant were awaking, and with
the awakening had come anxiety, longing, grief,
remorse, in short a knowledge of good through a
sudden apprehension of evil.</p>

<p>It was the portrait of a young Count of Monte
Beni (known as Donatello), whose family, an
ancient one, was believed to have sprung from the
union of one of those fabled woodland creatures,
half animal, half god, and an earthly maiden. At
long intervals the traits defining the origin of the
race were accentuated in a member of the family.
He was said to be ‘true Monte Beni.’ He lived
on the border line between two worlds, fearless
and happy, but also unthinking, a creature incapable
of doing wrong because his life was free,
natural, instinctive. Such was Donatello.</p>

<p>The idea of a creature who should unite the
characteristics of the wild and the human fascinated
Hawthorne. The charm is elusive, and must be
elusive or it is no longer charming. Hawthorne
warns us against letting the idea harden in our
grasp or grow coarse from handling. For this
reason (and not for the sake of petty mystification)
Hawthorne will not disclose the one physical trait
which would have completed Donatello’s resemblance
to the Faun, the pointed, furry ears. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
youth himself will jest with his friends on the subject,
but no more; the thick brown curls are never
brushed aside.</p>

<p>So in Donatello’s attachment to Miriam, the
mysterious beauty of the story, there is something
animal-like, at once pathetic and fierce. Love does
not awaken the intellect, however; the youth remains
a child until the wrathful moment when he
holds the mad Capuchin, Miriam’s persecutor,
over the edge of the precipice, and reads in the
girl’s consenting eyes approval of the deed he is
about to commit. At this point Donatello’s real
life begins.</p>

<p>The crime is far-reaching in its consequences,
blighting for weary months the happiness of the
gentle Hilda, a terrified eye-witness; but is most
sinister in its effect on Donatello, whose dumb
agony and remorse Hawthorne has painted with
a strong but subdued touch. Perhaps the most
striking of the incidents at Monte Beni is that
where the wretched Donatello tries to call the wild
creatures of the wood to him as he had been used
to do in the days of his innocence, and finds his
power gone, only some loathsome reptile coming
at his bidding.</p>

<p>Hilda is one of the triumphs of Hawthorne’s
art. By what necromancy did he contrive to invest
a character so ethereal with life and interest? For
the type is by no means one that invariably attracts,
and the mere symbolism of the shrine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
the doves, together with an innocence which carries
its own safeguard, might have been used unsuccessfully
a thousand times before being wrought
by Hawthorne’s subtile power into enduring form.</p>

<p>Kenyon is a proof of the instinct Hawthorne
had for avoiding the realistic fact. One would
fancy this a character which would take on realism
of its own accord, a character which could be depended
on to become human and bohemian, to
smoke, swear, tell emphatic stories, and yet be
gentle and high-minded withal, like Bret Harte’s
angel-miners. But Kenyon is almost as shadowy as
Hilda.</p>

<p>Miriam with her rich dark beauty (making her
in contrast with Hilda as Night to Day) is the one
strong human character, capable of infinite pity and
infinite devotion, a woman to die for—if the need
were, and such need is not uncommon in romances.
The shadow of a nameless crime hangs over her,
from which, though innocent, she cannot escape.
She has warned Donatello of the fatality that attends
her. She holds his love in esteem so light
as to be almost contempt until the moment when
he shows the force to grapple with her enemy;
then love flames up in her own heart. For her
Donatello stains his hands with blood, suffers
agony indescribable, and then ‘comes back to his
original self, with an inestimable treasure of improvement
won from an experience of pain.’
And as Miriam contemplates him on the day before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
he gives himself up to justice, she asks whether
the story of the fall of man has not been repeated
in the romance of Monte Beni.</p>

<p>The deficiencies and excesses of <i>The Marble
Faun</i> have been often pointed out. The superabundance
of guide-book description which disturbed
Sir Leslie Stephen was noted by Hawthorne
as a defect and apologized for in the preface. It
is astonishing how it fits into place when, after
an interval of several years, one comes to re-read
the story. <i>The Marble Faun</i> is a magical piece of
work, its very enigmas, mysteries, and its inconclusiveness
tending to heighten the effect. And it
does not in the least detract from the enjoyment
that one cannot follow the author to the extent
of believing it his best work.</p>

<span class="subhead">LATEST AND POSTHUMOUS WRITINGS</span>

<span class="subhead"><i>OUR OLD HOME</i>, <i>NOTE-BOOKS</i>, <i>DOLLIVER
ROMANCE</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><i>Our Old Home</i> is a volume of twelve chapters on
English life and experiences. Acute, frank, sympathetic,
modestly phrased, abounding in humor,
it may fairly be accounted one of the best of Hawthorne’s
works. The English are said to have been
disturbed by a number of the comments on their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
character and manners. If so, they must be as
touchy as Americans. <i>Our Old Home</i> contains
nothing that should offend, unless indeed it be an
offence to speak of one’s neighbor in any terms
not those of unmitigated eulogy. Hawthorne noted
certain differences between the national types of
the two countries and gave an account of them.
But of any disposition to laud his own people at
the expense of their British cousins, the book contains
not a trace.</p>

<p><i>Passages from the English Note-Books of Nathaniel
Hawthorne</i> is the raw material out of which
was fashioned such a charming and perfect literary
study as <i>Our Old Home</i>. It is idle to dispute over
the question whether the fragmentary journalizings
of an eminent author should or should not
be given to the public. They will always be given
to the public, and the public will always be grateful
for them, even though it has no deeper cause
for gratitude than that involved in satisfaction of
mere curiosity. At all events, the passion for looking
into the work-shop of a great artist cannot be
overcome. Perhaps this most trivial form of hero-worship
deserves countenance.</p>

<p>The <i>Note-Books</i> (English, Italian, and American)
bear the same relation to <i>Our Old Home</i> that
a man talking with his most trusted friend bears
to that same man when talking with an agreeable
chance acquaintance. In the one case he is wholly
unguarded, in the other he keeps himself in check<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
even at the moment he seems most frank and expansive.</p>

<p><i>The Dolliver Romance</i> is one of a group of
studies for an elaborate narrative in which Hawthorne
proposed to trace the fortunes of an American
family back to those of its English forebears.
The idea of connecting the obscure New England
branch of the house with the proud Old-World
descendants by some vague claim on the ancestral
estate is almost too common in fiction. But Hawthorne
seems to have been drawn towards it by
his life in the consulate at Liverpool, where he had
continually to check the exuberance of misguided
fellow-countrymen who had appropriated, in mind,
not a few of the finest estates in England, and
only lacked faint encouragement to attempt entering
on actual possession.</p>

<p>The idea of the Bloody Footstep was taken
from a tradition connected with Smithell’s Hall
in Bolton-le-Moors, and Hawthorne went to see
what purported to be the mark made in the stone
step by the unhappy man about whose mysterious
history the romance gathers. The quest and discovery
of an elixir of life is in itself a threadbare
motive, but could hardly have been commonplace
under Hawthorne’s treatment.</p>

<p>He was not to complete his design. The four
versions of the story, <i>The Dolliver Romance</i>, <i>The
Ancestral Footstep</i>, <i>Septimius Felton</i>, and <i>Doctor
Grimshawe’s Secret</i>, furnish another glimpse into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
Hawthorne’s literary studio, though we are warned
not to infer that he always worked in the way the
existence of these fragments might suggest.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Hawthorne was the most gifted of our American
romancers. In a certain sense his field was a
narrow one, but the soil was rich, and there was
magic in his husbandry. He himself once declared
that he never knew what patriotism was
until he met an Englishman; that he was not an
American, New England was as big a lump of
earth as he could hold in his heart. The defect
(if indeed it be a defect) was one of the sources
of his power. Hawthorne did indeed love New
England, but to suppose that he loved it with a
blind and uncritical love is wholly to misunderstand
both the man and his work. He was the
genius of his little world. He knew its poetry and
its prose, its mystery, charm, beauty, and its repellent
and sordid features. New England will
have no profounder interpreter, though it may be
that as the superficial characteristics of the people
change, his transcripts of life will increasingly take
on the qualities of pure romance.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Philippe Thoreau</span>, of the parish of Saint
Helier in the Isle of Jersey, had a son John
who emigrated to America and opened a store
on the Long Wharf in Boston. He married Jane
Burns, daughter of a well-to-do Scotchman from
the neighborhood of Stirling. John’s son John,
a lead-pencil maker of Concord, Massachusetts,
married Cynthia Dunbar, daughter of the Reverend
Asa Dunbar, of Keene, New Hampshire. Of their
four children Henry David Thoreau, the author
of <i>Walden</i>, was the third. He was born at Concord
on July 12, 1817.</p>

<p>After his graduation at Harvard in the Class of
1837, Thoreau taught school, learned surveying
and the art of making lead-pencils, and began writing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
and lecturing. The episode in his life which
gave him more than a local reputation was his camping
out by the shore of Walden Pond. He spent
two years and two months there studying how
‘to live deliberately.’ His hut, built by himself,
might have seemed bare and cheerless to a victim
of civilization. There was no carpet on the floor,
no curtain at the window. Every superfluity was
stripped off and life ‘driven into a corner’ in the
hope of discovering what it was made of. Thoreau
sturdily resisted the efforts of friends and neighbors
to burden him with trumpery, refusing the
gift of a door-mat on the plea that it was ‘best to
avoid the beginnings of evil,’ and throwing a
paper-weight out of the window ‘because it had
to be dusted every day.’</p>

<p>He raised his own vegetables in a patch of
ground near by, made his own bread, and spent
his leisure time in recording his observations of
nature and in writing his first book, <i>A Week on the
Concord and Merrimack Rivers</i>. When he was satisfied
with this taste of life ‘reduced to its lowest
terms,’ he went back to civilization.</p>

<p><i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack</i> was a failure,
as publishers say; meaning that it did not sell.
Having published at his own expense, Thoreau
was financially embarrassed when seven hundred
and fifty copies of an edition of a thousand came
back on his hands. He said to a friend: ‘I have
added several hundred volumes to my library<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
lately, all of my own composition.’<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> His second
venture, <i>Walden</i>, was more fortunate. He printed
a few articles in the ‘Boston Miscellany,’ ‘Putnam’s
Magazine,’ the ‘New York Tribune,’ ‘Graham’s
Magazine,’ and the ‘Atlantic Monthly,’ but at no
time could he be said to live by literature.</p>

<p>His income from his lectures must have been
small, and apparently he made no effort to obtain
engagements. He had an exalted idea of
what constitutes a good lecture, and was suspicious
of oratory. He told his English acquaintance
Cholmondeley that he was from time to time congratulating
himself on his ‘general want of success
as a lecturer.... I do my work clean as I go
along, and they will not be likely to want me anywhere
again.’</p>

<p>When Hawthorne was corresponding secretary
of the Salem Lyceum, he invited Thoreau in behalf
of the managers to give them a lecture. The
invitation was accepted. The lecture must have
had the fatal defect of being ‘interesting,’ for
Thoreau was asked to speak before the Lyceum a
second time the same winter.</p>

<p>Thoreau was a radical Abolitionist and for six
years refused to pay his poll-tax, on the ground
that the tax went indirectly to the support of
slavery. For this delinquency he was once lodged
in the town-jail over night. In 1857 he made the
acquaintance of ‘one John Brown’ as a Southern-born<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
president of a Northern college naïvely describes
that terrible old man. When two years later
news came of the desperate attempt at Harper’s
Ferry, Thoreau gave in a church vestry at Concord
his impassioned ‘Plea for Captain John Brown,’
which one of his admirers regards as the most
significant of his utterances.</p>

<p>Of the twelve volumes forming his collected
writings two only were seen by Thoreau in book
form. The remaining ten have been made up
of reprinted magazine articles or selections from
journals and letters. The list is as follows: <i>A
Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</i>, 1849;
<i>Walden; or, Life in the Woods</i>, 1854; <i>Excursions</i>
(edited by R. W. Emerson and Sophia Thoreau),
1863; <i>The Maine Woods</i>, 1864; <i>Cape Cod</i>, 1865;
<i>Letters to Various Persons</i> [with Poems], 1865;
<i>A Yankee in Canada, with Anti-Slavery and Reform
Papers</i>, 1866; <i>Early Spring in Massachusetts</i>,
1881; <i>Summer</i>, 1884; <i>Winter</i>, 1888; <i>Autumn</i>,
1892; <i>Miscellanies</i>, 1894; <i>Familiar Letters of
Henry David Thoreau</i>, 1894.</p>

<p>Thoreau ‘travelled widely’ in Concord and
made a few trips elsewhere. Aside from his excursions
to the Maine woods, the White Mountains,
Cape Cod, and Staten Island, he took no
long journey until 1861, when he went as far west
as Minnesota. He was in ill health then, and a
violent cold terminating in pulmonary consumption
brought about his death (May 6, 1862). It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
has been often mentioned as a strange fact that
this man who almost symbolized the out-of-door
existence, who chanted its praises, and who was
unhappy unless he had at least ‘four hours a day
in the woods and fields,’ should have died, at the
age of forty-five, of exposure to the elements
which (according to his whimsical philosophy)
were more friendly than man.</p>

<h3 id="sec_63">II<br />

<span class="subhead">THOREAU’S CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Without</span> posing, Thoreau contrived somehow to
gain the reputation of a poseur. Because his nose
was more Emersonian than Emerson’s, because
he lived for a time at Emerson’s house (where he
was beloved by every member of the family),
and because he affected the Orphic and seer-like
mode of expression, he was called an imitator. Because
he was a recluse and a stoic, and because his
letters were edited in a way to emphasize his
stoicism, he has been thought to lack the human
and friendly qualities.</p>

<p>The charge of imitation has been refuted by
those who knew him best. ‘Doubtless his growth
was stimulated by kindred ideas. This is all that
can be granted. Utter independence, strong individuality
distinguished him. His one foible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
was, not subserviency, but combativeness, mainly
from mere love of fence when he found a worthy
adversary, as his best friends knew almost too
well.’<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>In many ways Thoreau was much like other
men. He was a devoted son, a brotherly brother,
a helpful neighbor, a genial companion. We have
his own word for it that he could out-sit the
longest sitter in the village tap-room if there were
occasion.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he was not ‘approachable’
in the common meaning of the word. He puzzled
many people. He could be angular, stiff, remote,
encrusted. Howells saw him in 1860, ‘a quaint
stump figure of a man.’<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> He sat on one side of
the room, having first placed his visitor in a chair
on the other side. It was more difficult to get near
him spiritually than physically. He seemed almost
unconscious of his caller’s presence.</p>

<p>Emerson edited Thoreau’s letters so as to present
‘a most perfect piece of stoicism.’ It was the
side of his friend’s character in which he most
rejoiced. The book should be read exactly as
Emerson intended it to be read. Later it should be
supplemented by the <i>Familiar Letters</i>, which brings
into relief the affectionate and winning side of
Thoreau’s character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_64">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WRITER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Thoreau</span> was a painstaking student of the art of
expression, but never for its own sake, always as a
means to an end. One may conclude that it was
not mere author’s vanity which led him to resent
editorial tampering with his manuscript. He had
good reasons for believing that neither Curtis of
‘Putnam’s’ nor Lowell of ‘The Atlantic’ could
change his text to advantage. The question was
not one of mere nicety of phrase, but of that subtile
quality of style due to the inextricable interweaving
of the thought and the language in which
the thought is expressed.</p>

<p>An out-of-doors writer, Thoreau’s power to
produce was in direct ratio of his intercourse with
Nature. If shut up in the house he could not
write at all. When he walked he stored up literary
virtue. He believed that nothing was so good
for the man of letters as work with the hands. It
cleared the style of ‘palaver and sentimentality.’</p>

<p>The fresh wild beauty of Thoreau’s style (when
he is at his best) may be praised without reserve.
There is no danger of exaggerating its perfect
novelty and attractiveness; the danger is that we
may take the hint of these qualities for the reality.
Thoreau could be commonplace when he chose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_65">IV<br />

<span class="subhead">THE BOOKS</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Early</span> in September, 1839, the Thoreau brothers,
John and Henry, made a voyage down the Concord
and Merrimac rivers. The boat used was of
their own building. It was painted blue and green,
had wheels by which it could be dragged around
the dams, and must have been as ugly as it was
useful. <i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack</i> records
the unadventurous adventures of the two
young men both on this and other excursions.</p>

<p>It is a medley of prose and verse, of homely
common-sense and lofty speculation. Side by side
with realistic portraits of plain people, farmers,
fishermen, boatmen, and lock-keepers, are minute
and exquisite descriptions of the life of field, mountain,
stream, lake, and air. The literary allusions
are many, and taken from sources as wide apart
as the poles, Shattuck (the historian of Concord)
and Anacreon, Gookin and Chaucer. Here is to
be found the famous essay on Friendship, the
spirit of which may be partly divined from this
sentence: ‘I could tame a hyena more easily than
my friend.’</p>

<p>The poetry in the volume is a stumbling-block
to not a few readers. Doubtless it has its virtues,
but too often Thoreau’s poetry must be forgiven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
for the sake of his prose. The stiff, almost self-conscious
air of <i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack</i>
and the hobbling verse help to explain the
indifference of the author’s contemporaries to a
very original work.</p>

<p><i>Walden</i>, the second of Thoreau’s books, is the
better of the two, which does not mean that the first
could be spared. The style is easier, the flavor
more racy, the spirit more humorous. The attitude
of the writer is characteristically provoking
and pugnacious. The chapters abound in audacities
which at once pique and delight the reader.
This modern Diogenes-Crusoe, solving the problem
of existence on an improvised desert-island
two miles from his mother’s door-step, is a refreshing
figure.</p>

<p>Life in the woods fascinated Thoreau. <i>Walden</i>
is a tribute to this fascination. In the absence of
domestic sounds he had the murmur of the forest,
the cry of the loon, the ‘tronk’ of the frog, and
the clangor of the wild-goose. Society was plenty
and of the best. His neighbors were the squirrel,
the field-mouse, the phœbe, the blue jay. Human
companionship was not wanting, for there were
visitors of all sorts, from the half-witted to those
who had more wits than they knew what to do with.
Matter-of-fact people were amazed at the young
man’s way of living, lacking the penetration to
see that he might live as he did from the humor
of it. When sceptics asked him whether he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
thought he could subsist on vegetable food alone,
Thoreau, to strike at the root of the matter at once,
was accustomed to say that he ‘could live on board
nails.’ ‘If they cannot understand that they cannot
understand much that I say.’</p>

<p>The Walden episode was an experiment in
emancipation, and the book is a challenge to mankind
to live more simply and freely. Thoreau
mocks at the worship of luxury. ‘I would rather
sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than
be crowded on a velvet cushion. I would rather
ride on earth in an ox-cart, with a free circulation,
than go to heaven in the fancy car of an excursion
train and breathe a malaria all the way.’</p>

<p><i>Excursions</i> is a collection of nine essays. Some
of them are formal and scientific with the Thoreau-esque
flavor (‘Natural History of Massachusetts,’
‘The Succession of Forest Trees,’
‘Autumnal Tints,’ ‘Wild Apples’), others are
pure Thoreau (‘A Walk to Wachusett,’ ‘The
Landlord,’ ‘A Winter Walk,’ ‘Walking,’ ‘Night
and Moonlight’). The flavor of these ‘wildlings
of literature,’ as a devotee happily calls them, is
as marked almost as that of <i>Walden</i>. They are, in
fact, <i>Walden</i> in miniature.</p>

<p>The <i>Maine Woods</i> consists of three long essays,
‘Ktaadn,’ ‘Chesuncook,’ and ‘The Allegash and
East Branch.’ They are readable, informing, uninspired.
In the degree in which he left himself
out of his pages Thoreau became as tame and conventional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
as the most academic of writers. The
strength of some men of letters lies in conformity.
Thoreau is strongest in non-conformity.</p>

<p><i>Cape Cod</i> is far more characteristic than the
<i>Maine Woods</i>. He who likes the savor of salt and
the tonic of ocean air will enjoy this book whether
he cares for Thoreau or not. It is interesting as
an early contribution to the history of Cape Cod
folks by a historian who was more of an enigma
to the natives than they were to him.</p>

<p>The best part of <i>A Yankee in Canada</i> is not to
be found in the account of the excursion to Montreal
and Quebec, but in the sheaf of anti-slavery
and reform papers bound up in the same volume.
Here are printed the address on ‘Slavery in Massachusetts,’
the paper on ‘Civil Disobedience,’
containing the lively account of the author’s experience
in Concord jail, the two addresses on
John Brown, the essay on ‘Life without Principle,’
and the critical study of ‘Thomas Carlyle and his
Works.’</p>

<p>The four volumes named for the seasons are
valuable for the light they shed on Thoreau’s
method as a writer, and his skill and accuracy in
reporting the facts of Nature. They are sure to
be read by the faithful, because the genuine Thoreau
enthusiast can read his every line. The rest
of the world will be content to know him by two
or three of the twelve volumes bearing his name.
<i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
alden</i>, the <i>Familiar Letters</i>, and a few essays
from <i>Excursions</i> and the Anti-Slavery papers ought
to be sufficient.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>No more than greater men of letters can Thoreau
be disposed of in a paragraph. Some of his
pronounced characteristics can be, however.</p>

<p>He was a paradoxical philosopher. To praise
Nature at the expense of civilized society, to eulogize
the ‘perfection’ of the one and lament the
degradation of the other, to declare solemnly that
church spires deform the landscape, and that it
is a mistake to do a second time what has been
done once,—these declarations give a wholly incomplete
but, so far as they go, not unjust idea of
his manner. Taking Thoreau literally is a capital
way to breed a dislike for him. Grant him his own
manner of expressing his thought, make no effort
to exact conformity from so wayward a genius, and
at once you are, as Walt Whitman would say,
‘rapport’ with him. It is easy to exaggerate his
paradoxicalness. Say to yourself as you take up
the volume: ‘Now let us find out just how whimsical
this fellow can be,’ and straightway he disappoints
by not being whimsical at all.</p>

<p>If Thoreau’s praise of Nature at the expense
of Society seems to border on the absurd, one must
bear in mind how complete and intimate was his
knowledge of what he praised. His love of forest,
lake, hill, and mountain, of beast and bird, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
deep, passionate, unremitting. He speaks somewhere
of an old man so versed in Nature’s ways
that apparently ‘there were no secrets between
them.’ This might have been said of Thoreau
himself. He could pay lofty tributes to the ‘mystical’
quality in Nature; but he was not a mere
rhapsodist, a petty village Chateaubriand; he could
come straight down to tangible facts and recount
every detail of the advent of spring at Walden.
His power to see and his skill in describing the
thing seen unite to give the very atmosphere of
life in the woods.</p>

<p>He was himself so complete an original and his
literary attractiveness is such that Thoreau numbers
among his best friends not only those who
are nature-blind but the confirmed city-men as
well, the frequenters of clubs, the lovers of pavements
and crowds. That some of the most appreciative
tributes to his genius should have come
from these is but one paradox the more in the
history of him who (at times) delighted above all
else in the paradoxical.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Holmes</span> invented a phrase which became celebrated—‘the
Brahmin caste of New England,’
that is to say, an aristocracy of culture.
The inventor of the phrase belonged to the class.
He was a son of the Reverend Abiel Holmes,
minister of the First Church of Cambridge and
author of that ‘painstaking and careful work,’ the
<i>American Annals</i>.</p>

<p>Abiel Holmes (a great-grandson of John
Holmes, one of the settlers of Woodstock, Connecticut)
was twice married. His first wife was
Mary Stiles, daughter of President Ezra Stiles of
Yale College. Five years after her death he married
Sarah Wendell of Boston, who became the
mother of Oliver Wendell Holmes. Through the
Wendells, Holmes was related by one line of descent
to Anne Bradstreet; by another to Evert
Jansen Wendell of Albany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span></p>

<p>The author of <i>The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table</i>
was born at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Harvard
Commencement Day, August 29, 1809. After a
preliminary training at the Cambridgeport Academy
(where he had for schoolmates Margaret Fuller
and Richard Henry Dana) Holmes completed his
college preparation at Phillips Academy, Andover,
entered Harvard in the class of 1829, and in due
time was graduated.</p>

<p>He had, or thought he had, an inclination to
carry the ‘green bag,’ and to this end spent a year
at the Dane (now Harvard) Law School, in Cambridge.
He soon discovered a greater inclination
towards medicine and entered the private medical
school of Doctor James Jackson, in Boston. In
1833 he became a student at the École de Médecine
in Paris, and during two busy winters heard the
lectures of Broussais, Andral, Louis, and other
teachers.</p>

<p>In 1836 he began the practice of medicine in
Boston. During the two following years he competed
for and won four of the Boylston Prizes.
Enthusiastic in his profession, he found the life
of a general practitioner not to his liking, and
when, in 1838, the professorship of anatomy and
physiology at Dartmouth College was offered him,
he was ‘mightily pleased.’ He held the position
for two years (1839–40); residence at Hanover
was required for three months of each year.</p>

<p>Some time before going to Hanover, Holmes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
was writing to his friend Phineas Barnes, congratulating
him on having entered into ‘the beatific
state of duality,’ and wishing himself in like case.
‘I have flirted and written poetry long enough,’
he said, ‘and I feel that I am growing domestic
and tabby-ish.’ On June 15, 1840, he married
Miss Amelia Jackson, a daughter of Judge Charles
Jackson of Boston. She was a young woman of
rare endowments. ‘Every estimable and attractive
quality of mind and character seemed to be hers.’<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>In 1847 Holmes was appointed Parkman professor
of anatomy and physiology in the Harvard
Medical School. The multifarious extra cares involved
led him to say that in those early days he
occupied not a chair in the college but a settee.
He held the position for thirty-five consecutive
years.</p>

<p>The reputation which Holmes began early to
build up through his writings was partly literary,
partly scientific, partly a compound of both.
Lovers of well-turned and witty verse knew him
through his <i>Poems</i> (1836) and his metrical essays,
<i>Urania</i> (1846) and <i>Astræa</i> (1850). The public,
always solicitous about its health, heard or read
the two lectures on <i>Homœopathy and its kindred
Delusions</i> (1842). Physicians made his acquaintance
through the <i>Boylston Prize Dissertations</i>
(1836–37), and the <i>Essay on the Contagiousness of
Puerperal Fever</i> (1843).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span></p>

<p>Fame came to Holmes in 1857 when he began
printing in the newly founded ‘Atlantic Monthly’
a series of papers entitled <i>The Autocrat of the
Breakfast-Table</i>. Reprinted as a book, it at once
took its proper place as an American classic, and
now after forty-eight years its popularity seems in
no degree lessened.</p>

<p>The following list contains the principal works
upon which Holmes’s reputation as a man of
letters rests. A full bibliography must be consulted
if one would know the extent of his literary
and scientific activity: <i>The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table</i>,
1858; <i>The Professor at the Breakfast-Table</i>,
1860; <i>Currents and Counter-Currents, with
Other Addresses</i>, 1861; <i>Elsie Venner</i>, 1861; <i>Songs
in Many Keys</i>, 1862; <i>Soundings from the Atlantic</i>,
1864; <i>The Guardian Angel</i>, 1867; <i>The Poet at
the Breakfast-Table</i>, 1872; <i>Songs of Many Seasons</i>,
1875; <i>Memoir of John Lothrop Motley</i>, 1879; <i>The
Iron Gate and Other Poems</i>, 1880; <i>Pages from an
Old Volume of Life</i>, 1883; <i>A Mortal Antipathy</i>,
1885; <i>Ralph Waldo Emerson</i>, 1885; <i>Our Hundred
Days in Europe</i>, 1887; <i>Before the Curfew and Other
Poems</i>, 1888; <i>Over the Teacups</i>, 1891.</p>

<p>Holmes’s life was without marked incident. His
work at the Medical School, his public lectures,
social engagements, the normal and agreeable responsibilities
of home and society, filled the measure
of his days. The visit to England in 1886,
when he was made a D. C. L. by Oxford, a Litt. D.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
by Cambridge, and an LL. D. by Edinburgh, was
something like apotheosis, if the term be not too
extravagant.</p>

<p>He endured the evils consequent on old age
with philosophic composure, and it became at
the last a matter of scientific curiosity with him to
see how long he could maintain life. He was
spared a tedious illness, and died an almost painless
death on October 7, 1894.</p>

<h3 id="sec_67">II<br />

<span class="subhead">THE MAN</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Among</span> the ‘Autocrat’s’ distinguishing traits was
humanity. He has recorded the feeling of ‘awe-stricken
sympathy’ at first sight of the white faces
of the sick in the hospital wards. ‘The dreadful
scenes in the operating theatre—for this was
before the days of ether—were a great shock to
my sensibilities.’ His nerves hardened in time,
but he was always keenly alive to human suffering.
There is a note of contempt in his reference to
Lisfranc, the surgeon, who ‘regretted the splendid
guardsmen of the Empire because they had such
magnificent thighs to amputate.’</p>

<p>It was once said of Holmes that he was difficult
to catch unless he were wanted for some kind act.
He lost no opportunity to give happiness. In old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
age when flattery was tedious, and blindness imminent,
and the autograph hunter had become a burden,
he patiently wrote his name and transcribed
stanzas of ‘Dorothy Q.’ or ‘The Last Leaf’ for
admirers from all parts of the earth. This was
the smallest tax on his good nature. For years
he had been expected to act as counsel and sometimes
as literary agent for all the minor poets of
America. Many of these innocents conceived
Holmes as automatically issuing certificates to the
virtue of their work. He was always kind and
invariably plain-spoken. To the author of an epic
he wrote: ‘I cannot conscientiously advise you
to print your poem; it will be an expense to you,
and the gain to your reputation will not be an
equivalent.’</p>

<p>Holmes believed in the humanizing influences
of good blood, social position, and wealth. It was
no small matter, he thought, to have a descent from
men who had played their parts acceptably in the
drama of life. He preferred the man with the
‘family portraits’ to the man with the ‘twenty-cent
daguerreotype’ unless he had reason to believe
that the latter was the better man of the two.
His amusing poem, ‘Contentment,’ is not a jest,
but a plain statement of his philosophy.</p>

<p>Open-minded in literary and scientific matters,
he was delightfully conservative about places.
He respected the country and loved the town. A
city man, he was also a man of one city. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
professed to have been the discoverer of Myrtle
Street, the abode of ‘peace and beauty, and virtue,
and serene old age.’ Thus it looked to him as
he explored its ‘western extremity of sunny courts
and passages.’ Holmes’s books contain many
proofs of his cat-like attachment to city nooks
and corners, his liking for odd streets, unexpected
turns, and winding ways. ‘I have bored this ancient
city through and through, until I know it
as an old inhabitant of a Cheshire knows his
cheese.’</p>

<p>Holmes enjoyed above all the sense of an undisturbed
possession of things. He complained
of the march of modern improvement only when
he found himself improved out of one house
and driven to take refuge in another. He thought
that a wretched state of affairs whereby a man was
compelled to move every twenty or thirty years.</p>

<p>With his sunny nature Holmes found it difficult
to be a good hater. He had but two violent
antipathies, Calvinism and homœopathy. On these
he concentrated the little measure of asperity he
possessed, together with a large measure of vigorous
logic and frank contempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_68">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WRITER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">In</span> his characteristic prose style Holmes is easy,
familiar, off-hand, in short, conversational. He
may have spent hours over his paragraphs, but with
their air of unpremeditation they give no sign of
it. The manner of his prose is well-bred but nonchalant.
Yet there is always a note of reserve.
The Autocrat is less familiar than he seems.</p>

<p>The conversational style permits abrupt turns,
sudden transitions, a pleasant negligence. It also
has narrow limits; it cannot rise to eloquence, and
fine writing is apt to seem out of place. Holmes
knew pretty accurately the limits of his instrument.</p>

<p>Like other practised writers, he varied his style
to fit his subject. And while a certain winsomeness
is never wanting, it is less apparent in the
novels than in the ‘Breakfast-Table’ books, and
in the biographies than in the novels. Often he
becomes business-like, extremely matter of fact,
clearly determined to make his point or to solve
his problem without waste of words or superfluous
ornament.</p>

<p>With respect to his verse we have been told
that Holmes was a ‘consummate master of all that
is harmonious, graceful, and pleasing in rhythm
and in language.’ Had the eulogist been speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
of Tennyson, or Swinburne, or Shelley, he
could have said little more. Holmes’s verse is
neat, precise, felicitous, often graceful, unmistakably
clever, abounding in pointed phrase and happy
rhyme, but taken as a whole it must be adjudged
the poetry of a cultivated gentleman and a wit
rather than the poetry of a poet.</p>

<p>Much of it has a distinctly old-fashioned air, contrasting
oddly with the freshness and ‘modernity’
of the poet’s prose. In his own phrase Holmes
‘was trained after the schools of classical English
verse as represented by Pope, Goldsmith, and
Campbell.’ The metrical essays (<i>Poetry</i>, <i>Astræa</i>,
<i>Urania</i>) show how strong was the Eighteenth-century
influence. The choice of metre cannot
be questioned. If audiences will have poetic dissertations,
they probably suffer least under the
heroic couplet. It is easy to comprehend, and not
difficult to write; and the form of the verse tempts
to cleverness.</p>

<h3 id="sec_69">IV<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>THE AUTOCRAT</i> AND ITS COMPANIONS,
<i>OVER THE TEACUPS</i>, <i>OUR HUNDRED
DAYS IN EUROPE</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> motto, ‘Every man his own Boswell,’ on the
title-page of <i>The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table</i>,
is a key to the book. The conceit has merits besides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
that of novelty. There is a world of humorous
suggestion in the idea of ‘doubling’ the parts
of philosophic wit and worshipping reporter.</p>

<p>The scene is a Boston boarding-house with its
more or less commonplace people, the landlady,
her daughter, her son Benjamin Franklin, the
young fellow called John, the old gentleman who
sits opposite, the poor relation, the divinity student,
the schoolmistress, and the Autocrat himself.
They talk, listen, jest, laugh. Little by little the
commonplace characters grow attractive. Pleasant
and lovable traits come to light. There is pathos,
sentiment, a deal of mirth, but little action. The
Autocrat marries the schoolmistress towards the
close of the book. So much likeness is there to
an old-fashioned love story, and no more.</p>

<p>In general the characters interest less for what
they say than for what they prompt the Autocrat
to say. He says many things, and all so wise, so
entertaining, so clever. When Holmes threw off
these sparkling paragraphs month by month, he
could have had little idea what the index would
reveal. He glances from subject to subject, touching
lightly here and lightly there. Poetry, pugilism,
horse-racing, theology, and tree-lore are all equally
interesting to him and to us. The reader is not
too long detained by any one thing. An infinite
number of topics are handled with effervescent
gayety in a manner sometimes called ‘French.’
Holmes accused Emerson of want of logical sequence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
That was a master stroke. Open a volume
of the Breakfast-Table series at random and
you chance on the oddest combinations of subjects,
as when a paragraph on insanity is followed by a
paragraph on private theatricals—perhaps a less
illogical juxtaposition than at first sight appears.
Waywardness and inconsequence are among the
principal charms of <i>The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table</i>.</p>

<p>That a book so distinctively local in atmosphere
and allusion should have attained at once and
kept to this day widespread popularity is a little
surprising. For local it is—provincial, as New
Yorkers would say. At all events, it is Bostonian
to the last degree. The little city, compact and
picturesque, was not merely the background, the
scene of the breakfast-table episodes and conversations;
the entire volume is saturated with the atmosphere
of Boston. To Holmes it was the one
city worth while, the city whose State House was
Hub of the Solar System. By his testimony (and
who should know better?) you could not pry
that out of a Boston man if you had the tire of all
creation straightened out for a crowbar.</p>

<p>The <i>Autocrat</i> was followed by the <i>Professor</i> and
the <i>Poet</i>. The critical history of sequels is well
known. Seldom a complete failure, they are rarely
an unqualified success. Yet it is not easy to see
wherein <i>The Professor at the Breakfast-Table</i> falls
much below <i>The Autocrat</i>. The book would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
justified were it only for the pathetic figure of
Little Boston, to say nothing of Iris, the young
Marylander, the Model of all the Virtues, and the
Koh-i-noor. It is something, too, to have seen the
landlady’s daughter appropriately wedded to an
undertaker, and the young fellow called John also
married, and in possession of ‘one of them little
articles’ for which he had longed in the days of
bachelorhood, to wit, a boy of his own.</p>

<p><i>The Poet at the Breakfast-Table</i>, a storehouse of
delightful inventions, proved the least attractive
of the three to the public. But all of Holmes’s
old-time skill returned when he wrote <i>Over the
Teacups</i>, his last book. The framework is simple
but attractive, the characters have genuine vitality
and pique the reader by suggesting that they
must have been drawn from life. The Dictator
is an old friend. Number Five, the Tutor, the
Counsellor, the two Annexes, Number Seven,
the Mistress and Delilah are agreeable acquaintances,
and the misfortune is ours if we do not know
them as well as the figures of <i>The Autocrat</i>.</p>

<p>All these books are personal, known as such,
and deriving half their charm from the reader’s
ability to recognize Holmes himself under various
disguises. In <i>Our Hundred Days in Europe</i> the
author speaks <i>in propria persona</i>, and the volume
may be described as a big printed letter addressed
to the writer’s friends, who, loving him as they do,
will rejoice in his happiness and his triumphs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_70">V<br />

<span class="subhead">THE POET</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> Autocrat’s poetical works contain a generous
measure of what elderly bards call their ‘juvenilia.’
We all understand the term. It means
verses which the bards in question would gladly
have left in the solitude of old magazines, and
which admirers insist on dragging into light,—poems
that help to stock the school readers and
speakers, and which, because the copyright has
expired by the unjust law of the land, compilers
of anthologies seize on and parade as representative.</p>

<p>That Holmes suffers but little by the persistence
of his ‘juvenilia’ and ‘early verses’ is due to
their frankly comic and grotesque character. The
reader is spared faded sentiment, and he is heartily
amused by the ingenuity of the conceits, the sparkle
of the rhymes, the satire, the epigrammatic
wit. There is mirth still in that brilliant essay in
verbal gymnastics ‘The Comet’ (a dyspeptic’s
dream), in ‘The September Gale’ (a boy’s lament
for his Sunday breeches, blown from the line one
fatal wash-day and never recovered), in ‘The
Spectre Pig’ (a parody on Dana’s ‘Buccaneer’),
in ‘The Height of the Ridiculous,’ ‘Daily Trials,’
‘The Treadmill Song,’ ‘The Dorchester Giant,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
‘The Music-Grinders,’ and the heartlessly funny
poem entitled ‘My Aunt.’</p>

<p>Holmes was the readiest and the happiest of
‘occasional’ poets. No one was so apt as he in
meeting the needs of the moment, in brightening
with rhymed felicities the banquet, the class
reunion, or in greeting the distinguished stranger.
He had rare skill in fitting the word to the audience;
it was impossible for him to be dull, and
being good-humored, it was difficult for him to
say ‘No’ when committees were importunate. Of
his three hundred and twenty-seven poems, nearly
one half are poems of occasion. He wrote the
greeting to Charles Dickens, to the Prince Imperial,
a poem for the Moore celebration, for the
dedication of the Stratford Fountain, for the two
hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding
of Harvard College. His poems for the Class of
1829, forty-four in number, reflect the history
of the times as well as the mood of the writer.
The most famous of them is ‘The Boys’ (1859).
Its motive, that boy-nature never quite dies in the
man, and its defiant optimism were calculated to
have rejuvenating effect on a group of classmates
then thirty years out of college.</p>

<p>This art requires a quality of mind akin to that
of the improvisatore. Holmes was Boston’s poet
laureate. His power to put an idea into self-singing
measure saved the battle-ship ‘Constitution,’ and
did much to save the ‘Old South’ Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span></p>

<p>In his finer work there is a delicious blending
of thoughtfulness and humorous fancy. Only
Holmes could have given the lines on ‘Dorothy
Q.’ their most original touch,—asking what would
have been the result for <i>him</i> had prospective great-grandmother
said ‘No’ instead of <span class="locked">‘Yes’:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Should I be I, or would it be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One tenth another to nine tenths me?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Half the pathos in that fragile and beautiful
piece of workmanship, ‘The Last Leaf,’ derives
from the humor, from the blending of laughter
and tears. Even in the exquisite piece, attributed
to Iris, ‘Under the Violets,’ a description of a
young girl’s burial-place, the lighter touch is not
wholly <span class="locked">wanting:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When, turning round their dial-track,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Eastward the lengthening shadows pass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her little mourners, clad in black,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The crickets, sliding through the grass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Shall pipe for her an evening mass.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His highest flights are represented by ‘The
Chambered Nautilus’ and ‘Musa,’ by the quaint
and fanciful ‘Homesick in Heaven,’ and by the
simple and pathetic little lament entitled ‘Martha.’
His claim to the name of poet must rest on these,
on his fine setting of the romance of Agnes
Surriage, and on his tributes to Bryant and to
Everett.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_71">VI<br />

<span class="subhead">FICTION AND BIOGRAPHY</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Holmes</span> wrote three novels. Although readable,
original, based on a thorough comprehension of
the scenes described, the life, antecedents, prejudices,
habits, and manners of the people portrayed,
nevertheless they strike one as being experiments
in fiction rather than true novels. They may be
classed with similar attempts by J. G. Holland
and Bayard Taylor. Each of these writers was a
practised craftsman. The trained man of letters
can write a volume which he, his friends, his publishers,
the public, and many fair-minded critics
agree in calling a novel. But the book in question
does not become a novel from having been cast
in the orthodox form. It resembles a novel more
nearly than it resembles anything else, nevertheless
it is not a veritable novel. Any reader can feel it,
though he may not be able to say just where the
difference lies, or how there happens to be a difference.
Many a writer, it would seem, has only to
continue his efforts to arrive finally at the making
of a true novel. He falls short because his mind
is working in an unwonted medium rather than
because he lacks inventive ability.</p>

<p>If <i>Elsie Venner</i> and <i>The Guardian Angel</i> fail of
being true novels, they are at least highly successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
studies in fiction and have given and will
continue to give a world of pleasure. If <i>A Mortal
Antipathy</i> falls short of the excellence attained by
the other two, it has at least the virtue of having
been written by a man who could not be uninteresting,
no matter what was his age or his humor.</p>

<p><i>Elsie Venner</i> is a study in prenatal influences.
The motive is gruesome enough. A young woman,
bitten by a snake, transmits certain tendencies
thus derived to her child. The subject was better
adapted to Hawthorne’s pen than to the Autocrat’s.
A man of science knows too much. Imagination
is hampered. ‘What is’ and ‘What might be’ are
in perpetual conflict. A poet (such as Hawthorne
essentially was) throws science to the winds.
Holmes goes at the problem in a brisk, business-like
way. Hawthorne would have treated it as a
mystery, not dragging it into broad light.</p>

<p><i>Elsie Venner</i> was dramatized and staged. Holmes
went to see it. What he thought of the play at
the time is not recorded, but in after years he
pronounced it ‘bad, very bad.’</p>

<p><i>The Guardian Angel</i> also deals with the question
of heredity. The problem of how many of our
ancestors come out in us, and just how they make
themselves felt, was always fascinating to Holmes.
There are no snakes in this story to account for
Myrtle Hazard’s peculiarities, but something quite
as enigmatical, namely, an Indian. One character
in <i>The Guardian Angel</i> has come near to achieving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
immortality—Gifted Hopkins, the minor poet,
whose name was an inspiration. He represents a
harmless and much-abused race. The successful in
his own craft are even more impatient with him
than the mockers among the laity, probably because
Gifted, in the innocence of his heart, desires
to have his verses read, and sends them to eminent
poets under the mistaken impression that they will
be welcome. Holmes confessed that he had been
hard on Gifted Hopkins.</p>

<p>The memoir of <i>John Lothrop Motley</i>, in addition
to being a formal record of personal history and
literary achievement, is a spirited defence of a
proud, a gifted, and (in the biographer’s opinion)
an ill-used man, a man who, after years of successful
public service, was needlessly and wantonly
humbled and mortified. Hence the note of fine
indignation which vibrates through the narrative.</p>

<p>The life of <i>Emerson</i> contributed by Holmes to
the series of ‘American Men of Letters’ was a
surprise to the public. To call for judgment on
the most transcendental of New England authors
by the least transcendental, to invite the poet of
‘The One-Hoss Shay’ to pronounce on the poet
of ‘The Sphinx,’ seems an odd if not a humorous
performance. Whoever suggested it did a wise
thing, and the result of the suggestion was a useful
and agreeable piece of biographical writing.</p>

<p>The work is thoroughly done, even to an
analysis of the individual essays. Who will, may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
view Emerson through the Autocrat’s eyes. They
had a close bond in their liking for the tangible
facts of life. ‘Too much,’ says Holmes, ‘has been
made of Emerson’s mysticism. He was an intellectual
rather than an emotional mystic, and withal
a cautious one. He never let go the string of his
balloon.’</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>That we read Holmes on Emerson less for the
sake of Emerson than for the sake of Holmes suggests
the possibility that we read all the Autocrat’s
books in the same spirit. Without question his
work is of value in the degree in which it reveals
its author. He could not be impersonal, he could
not be dramatic. But he was fortunate in that he
could always be himself. He was one of the most
delightful of men. And being likewise one of the
friendliest of writers he is most successful when
the form of his books, like <i>The Autocrat</i> and <i>Over
the Teacups</i>, permits him, as it were, to bring his
easy chair into the centre of the room while we
gather about him anxious to have him begin to
talk, hoping that he will be in no haste to leave
off.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Motley</span> was born at Dorchester, Massachusetts,
on April 15, 1814. His great-grandfather,
John Motley, came from Belfast, Ireland,
early in the Eighteenth Century, and settled at
Falmouth, now Portland, Maine. His father,
Thomas Motley, a prosperous merchant of Boston,
married Anna Lothrop, daughter of the Reverend
John Lothrop. The historian, the second-born
of their eight children, was named in honor of his
maternal grandfather.</p>

<p>After a course of study under Cogswell and
Bancroft at the Round Hill School, Motley entered
Harvard College and was graduated in 1831.
He was noted both at Northampton and Cambridge
for intellectual brilliancy rather than studiousness,
for a regal manner which did not tend to
make him universally popular, and for rare personal
beauty as was becoming in a youth whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
parents were reputed in their younger days ‘the
handsomest pair the town of Boston could show.’
He was a wit. ‘Give me the luxuries of life and
I will dispense with the necessaries,’ is one of his
best-known sayings. His passions were literary,
he admired Shelley and enjoyed the cleverness of
Praed. Although fond of versifying, he seems to
have printed little or nothing.</p>

<p>After graduation Motley spent two years
(1832–33) at German universities. He went first
to Göttingen, where he made the acquaintance of
Bismarck. They were fellow-students the next
year at Berlin. ‘We lived in closest intimacy,
sharing meals and outdoor exercise,’ said Bismarck
in a letter to Holmes.</p>

<p>His period of foreign study having come to
an end, Motley read law in Boston and was admitted
to the bar. In 1837 he married Miss Mary
Benjamin, a young woman noted for her beauty,
cleverness, and an open-hearted sincerity which
‘made her seem like a sister to those who could
help becoming her lovers.’<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> Two years after his
marriage Motley made his literary beginning by
publishing a novel, <i>Morton’s Hope, or the Memoirs
of a Provincial</i>, and in 1849 he published yet
another, <i>Merry-Mount, a Romance of the Massachusetts
Colony</i>. Neither was successful. Perhaps
the second failure was required to emphasize the
lesson taught by the first, that the author’s gifts were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
not for imaginative work.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> He was more fortunate
with a group of three essays printed in the ‘North
American Review,’ one on ‘Peter the Great’
(1845), one on ‘Balzac’ (1847), the third on ‘The
Polity of the Puritans’ (1849).</p>

<p>The first subject was suggested to Motley during
a residence of several months in St. Petersburg
as Secretary to the American Legation (1841–42).
This taste of diplomatic life seems not to have
been wholly relished. Motley’s wife could not
accompany him, and homesickness and a Russian
winter conspired to drive him back to America.
He gained some knowledge of practical politics
by serving a term in the Massachusetts legislature
(1849). Neither law, nor diplomacy, nor yet politics,
seemed at that time to offer a field in which
he could work to best advantage. More and more
he was tending towards literature. So absorbed
had he become in the history of Holland that he
felt it ‘necessary to write a book on the subject,
even if it were destined to fall dead from the
press.’ He had made some progress when he
heard of Prescott’s projected history of Philip the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
Second. Thinking it ‘disloyal’ not to declare his
ambition of invading a part of Prescott’s own
domain, he went to lay his plan before the elder
historian. Prescott immediately offered the use of
books from his library and was in all ways cordial
and enthusiastic.</p>

<p>It soon became evident that a history of Holland
could not be written in America. In 1851
Motley took his family and went abroad, and for
the next five years toiled unweariedly among the
archives of Dresden, The Hague, Brussels, and
Paris. His energy and plodding patience surprised
the friends who remembered Motley for a
brilliant young man who heretofore had played
industriously at work rather than actually worked.
‘He never shrank from any of the drudgery of
preparation,’ said his daughter, Lady Harcourt,
in after years.</p>

<p>The three volumes of <i>The Rise of the Dutch
Republic</i> were at length ready for the press. Motley
was forced to publish at his own expense.
Notwithstanding hostile criticisms, the success was
undeniable. The book was immediately translated
into French, German, and Dutch. Of two French
versions the one published in Paris was edited,
with an introduction, by Guizot.</p>

<p>The historical series as we have it comprises
nine volumes. The works appeared in the following
order: <i>The Rise of the Dutch Republic</i>, 1856;
<i>History of the United Netherlands</i>, 1860–68; <i>The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
Life and Death of John of Barneveld</i>, 1874. Motley’s
plan included a history of the Thirty Years’
War. But he was not to be granted length of days
sufficient for the writing of this ‘last act of a great
drama.’</p>

<p>Among many scholastic honors which in the
nature of things fell to Motley’s share may be
mentioned the conferring of the degree of D. C. L.
by Oxford, and the election to full membership
in the Institute of France.</p>

<p>Shortly after the fall of Fort Sumter, Motley
published in the London ‘Times’ two letters on
the significance and justice of the war. They had
a marked effect in England and were reprinted in
America. In June, 1861, the Austrian government
having refused to accept the minister sent to
Vienna, Motley was accredited to the mission.
After discharging the duties of his office with
marked ability during the four troubled years of
Lincoln’s administration, and through two years
of Johnson’s, he resigned because of an affront
offered him by his own government.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>During the political campaign of 1868 Motley
gave an address in Music Hall, Boston, on ‘Four
Questions for the People at the Presidential Election.’
On December 16, as orator at the sixty-first
anniversary of the New York Historical Society,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
he spoke on ‘Historic Progress and American
Democracy.’ In the spring of 1869 President
Grant assigned Motley to the English mission,
and in July, 1870, recalled him. The reasons given
for this summary act have never been satisfactory
to Motley’s friends. It is a question for experts.
If Motley’s indiscretion (or offence) was great, his
punishment was severe, and the manner of it not
undeserving of the epithet brutal.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>Motley’s health is believed to have been affected
by distress of mind over the recall. But the real
disaster of his latter years was the loss of his wife.
He survived her only two and a half years. His
death occurred at Kingston Russell, near Dorchester,
England, on May 29, 1877.</p>

<p>Dean Stanley in his tribute to Motley at Westminster
Abbey used the striking phrase, ‘an historian
at once so ardent and so laborious.’ J. R.
Green, who heard the sermon, thought the phrase
‘most happy.’ Said Green: ‘I should have liked
Stanley to have pointed out the thing which strikes
me most in Motley, that alone of all men past
and present he knit together not only America
and England, but that Older England which
we left on Frisian shores, and which grew into
the United Netherlands. A child of America,
the historian of Holland, he made England his
adopted country, and in England his body lies.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_73">II<br />

<span class="subhead">HIS CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Motley’s</span> letters afford the best insight into his
generous, affectionate, richly endowed, and manly
nature. They mirror his complete happiness in
the home circle, his chivalrous devotion to the
woman of his choice, his loyalty to his friends,
and his passionate love of native land. They do
not show—nor was it intended by the editor
that they should—his fiery impatience, his quick
resentment, his sensitive pride, his occasional and
pardonable bitterness.</p>

<p>A dominant trait of Motley’s character was
intensity of the patriotic sentiment. Much was
required of a ‘good American’ who, living in
Europe during the Civil War, frequented the
circles Motley frequented—much in the way of
tact, patience, and, above all, courage and hopefulness.
Motley, who was far from being a placid,
unreflecting optimist, had need of all his philosophy
as he saw everywhere proofs of satisfaction
in America’s misfortune. He had not only to
meet a frank antagonism which could be understood
and dealt with, but a hostility which took
the galling form of suave assurances that his country
was positively going to the dogs, and on the
whole it was a very good thing that it was. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
gentlemen did not exactly call on him for the purpose
of telling him so, they managed sometimes
to leave that impression. Motley’s services to his
country in meeting every form of attack, direct or
insidious, in the spirit of high confidence, were very
great. The extent of his usefulness has not yet
been fully measured.</p>

<p>He was free from literary vanity and would have
been quite unmoved had his books come short of
their actual fortune. His way of accepting the real
or the superficial tributes to success shows the man.
Honorary degrees, elections to learned societies,
drawing-room lionizing, passing compliments, were
taken exactly for what they were worth. He was
as far removed from the absurdity of being elated
by these things as he was from the absurdity of
pretending not to care. No one could have been
more alive to the significance of a degree from
Oxford, yet Motley seems to have got the most
of comfort on that occasion from the odd spectacle
of the Doctors marching in the rain, and among
them old Brougham ‘with his wonderful nose
wagging lithely from side to side as he hitched
up his red petticoats and stalked through the
mud.’</p>

<p>The letters reveal so many pleasant traits as to
make it difficult to comprehend the hostility which
pursued the writer. Holmes throws a deal of light
on that question by a single remark. Motley, he
says, ‘did not illustrate the popular type of politician.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
The fact is, he illustrated everything that
was opposed to that type. An uncompromising
upholder of the democratic theory, a bitter foe of
absolutism, a eulogist of the people, Motley was
himself an aristocrat to the finger-tips. ‘He had
a genuine horror of vulgarity in all its forms,’
said one of his friends, and doubtless he showed
it. An ‘instinctive repugnance to bad manners
and coarse-grained men’ was a trait ill-suited to
popularity. Motley’s high-bred bearing alone
constituted an offence. But he was incapable of
so much policy as was involved in pretending to
a bonhomie that was unnatural to him. He had a
pliancy of nature fitted to the complex needs of a
very complex social organization, but that was not
enough to satisfy all his exacting countrymen. And
among them were those who disliked him for being
the gentleman he was.</p>

<h3 id="sec_74">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WRITER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> historian of the Dutch Republic writes as one
who thinks nobly, admires with enthusiasm, and
hates without pettiness. ‘His thoughts are masculine,
full of argumentation,’ and as are his
thoughts so is his style. Often the language seems
charged with his own energy and chivalric impulsiveness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
At such times the style is eager, mettlesome,
impetuous, it glows with intensity of feeling.</p>

<p>Motley was not a ‘fine’ writer in the sense of
being visibly scrupulous about the choice of words
and the balance of sentences. He impresses one
as of the opinion that a man can ill afford to give
too much time to the problem of expression. But
he is far from being indifferent to the reader. He
is not merely willing, he prefers to please, provided
that in so doing he is not diverted from his
main purpose. The prevailing characteristics of
his style are a natural dignity and a manly negligence.</p>

<p>He imparts vividness by means of detailed conversations
among the actors of the historic drama.
These colloquies have at times the air of being
inventions of the historian, like the speeches in
Xenophon. Conscious that a device intended to
give reality might affect the sceptical mind quite
otherwise, Motley more than once explained that
‘no historical personage is ever made, in the text,
to say or write anything, save what, on ample
evidence, he is known to have said or written.’</p>

<p>The reader who turns from Prescott to Motley
at once discovers that the younger historian weaves
a dense, firm web. Appropriating an admirable
figure invented by Henry James and used with respect
to Balzac’s style, it may be said that if Motley’s
work is not at every point cloth of gold, it has at
least a metallic rigidity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_75">IV<br />

<span class="subhead">THE HISTORIES</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> struggle of the Dutch for religious and political
liberty was to have been ‘only an episode’ in
Prescott’s <i>Philip the Second</i>. Motley’s broad treatment
of the theme requires nine octavo volumes.
<i>The Rise of the Dutch Republic</i> (in three volumes)
covers the time between the abdication of Charles
the Fifth and the murder of William of Orange.
The <i>History of the United Netherlands</i> (in four volumes)
takes up the narrative at the death of William
and carries it on to the end of the Twelve Years’
Truce. <i>John of Barneveld</i>, is ‘the natural sequel’
to the two preceding works, and ‘a necessary introduction’
to the history of the Thirty Years’ War.</p>

<p>These works from first to last are marked by
passionate admiration of the spirit which makes for
liberty. Admitting the turbulent character of that
spirit in the early history of the Netherlands, the
historian does not deplore it. Sedition and uproar
meant life. ‘Those violent little commonwealths
had blood in their veins! They were compact
of proud, self-helping muscular vigor.’ And to
Motley ‘the most sanguinary tumults which they
ever enacted in the face of day were better than
the order and silence born of the midnight darkness
of despotism.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span></p>

<p>The treatment then is strongly partisan. There
is a fervor in the account of the deeds and sufferings
of those patriots who thought no sacrifice too
great if thereby the sum total of human liberty
was increased.</p>

<p>Motley does not pretend that the leaders in this
struggle were always disinterested. The motives
swaying humanity are wondrously complex. But
after all deductions are made, it was a struggle of
light against darkness, and with such a struggle it
was possible to sympathize unqualifiedly. There
are cool-blooded critics who view such an attitude
with disdain. This, they say, is not the temper in
which history should be written. History must be
calm, impartial, scientific. Perhaps the reasonable
reply is that history must be of many sorts and the
product of many types of mind; that one sort
never really excludes the other. Also it is well to
remember that a great historical master of our
time,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> and one whose creed was by no means narrow,
pleaded always for this deep and passionate
motive in the work, and laughed at the modern
Oxford product which can balance questions but
is able to accomplish nothing.</p>

<p>Motley’s historic canvas is crowded with figures.
The eye is at first drawn toward the personages,
the military, ecclesiastical, and princely chiefs,
William of Orange (who is Motley’s hero), Egmont,
Alva, and Granvelle; but the eye does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
rest on these alone. Surrounding them are the
multitudes of aspiring, suffering people becoming
more and more a preponderant force in the life of
the nation, refusing to be disposed of in the lump,
or driven about like a flock of sheep to be sheared
or slaughtered at the whim of a monarch.</p>

<p>Here lies Motley’s sympathy. His indignation
flames out when misery is brought upon thousands,
by the caprice of kings or the selfishness of secular
and ecclesiastical politicians. Note his sarcasm on
the battle of Saint Quentin, a game in which ‘the
players were kings and the people were stakes—not
parties.’ Note his fine scorn of that type of
government ‘which was administered exclusively
for the benefit of the government.’ Note his
loathing for that type of vanity which presumes
to dictate how a man shall worship God. The
temper in which Motley writes is admirably epitomized
in the picture of Caraffa, as papal legate,
making his entry into Paris, showering blessings
upon the people, ‘while the friends who were nearest
him were aware that nothing but gibes and
sarcasms were falling from his lips.... It would
no doubt have increased the hilarity of Caraffa
... could the idea have been suggested to his
mind that the sentiments, or the welfare of the
people throughout the great states ... could
have any possible bearing upon the question of
peace or war. The world was governed by other
influences. The wiles of a cardinal—the arts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
of a concubine—the speculations of a soldier of
fortune—the ill temper of a monk—the mutual
venom of Italian houses—above all, the perpetual
rivalry of the two great historical families
who owned the greater part of Europe between
them as their private property—such were the
wheels on which rolled the destiny of Christendom.
Compared to these, what were great moral
and political ideas, the plans of statesmen, the
hopes of nations? Time was to show.... Meanwhile
a petty war for petty motives was to precede
the great spectacle which was to prove to Europe
that principles and peoples still existed, and that
a phlegmatic nation of merchants and manufacturers
could defy the powers of the universe, and
risk all their blood and treasure, generation after
generation, in a sacred cause.’<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>The historian is a hard hitter. The enemies of
liberty and their agents are not spared. Philip,
Granvelle, Alva, and a score besides are characterized
in withering terms. Of Philip, for example,
Motley says: ‘It is curious to observe the minute
reticulations of tyranny which he had begun already
to spin about a whole people, while cold,
venomous, and patient he watched his victims
from the center of his web.’ The historian is
fiery in denouncing the tortuous and Machiavellian
politics of the Sixteenth Century. It was an
age when honesty, plain speaking, and respect for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
a promise had nothing to do with the conduct of
affairs of state. He who could lie most adroitly
was the best man. Granvelle fills his letters with
innuendoes against Egmont and Orange, all the
while protesting that he would not have a hair of
their heads injured. It is he, according to Motley,
who puts into Philip’s mind the thoughts he is to
think, almost in the words in which he is to utter
them. Philip had his own strength, but he was
slow to come to a conclusion. Granvelle knew
how to clarify that muddy stream of ideas.</p>

<p>The preceding work shows the Dutch states
in the beginning and progress of their struggle
against the tyranny of Philip; the <i>United Netherlands</i>
shows Holland as a rising hope of Protestantism,
as a nation to be reckoned with in the
diplomacy of Europe.</p>

<p>The Spanish king is still writing letters, still
concocting schemes for conquest, still enmeshing
friends and enemies alike in a web of falsehood.
He is drawn off for the moment from his mission
in the Netherlands to extend his conquests
elsewhere. These proposed conquests have exactly
one object—to enable the spirit of despotism
‘to maintain the old mastery of mankind.’
‘Countries and nations being regarded as private
property to be inherited or bequeathed to a
few favored individuals, ... it had now become
right and proper for the Spanish monarch to
annex Scotland, England, and France to the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
considerable possessions which were already his
own.’</p>

<p>A picturesque episode of the attempt upon England
was the Armada. To this enterprise Motley
gives one of his best and most thrilling chapters.
Equally fascinating is the account of the attempt
upon France, the battle of Ivry (when the white
plume of Henry of Navarre carried the hopes of
all liberal-minded men), and the terrible siege of
Paris which almost immediately followed. ‘Rarely
have men at any epoch defended their fatherland
against foreign oppression with more heroism
than that which was manifested by the Parisians
of 1590 in resisting religious toleration, and in
obeying a foreign and priestly despotism.’</p>

<p>Perhaps there are not to be found in the historian’s
works more striking passages than those
in which are described the last days of Philip the
Second. To Philip’s fortitude, in agony as poignant
as any he had visited upon his miserable victims,
the historian gives unstinted praise. The account,
which rests upon documentary basis, presents an
accumulation of horrors from which a Zola or a
Flaubert might have learned a lesson. The king
died with a clear conscience, having upon his soul
the blood of uncounted numbers of human beings,
and providing in his will that ‘thirty thousand
masses should be said for his soul.’</p>

<p>‘It seems like mere railing to specify his crimes,’
says Motley. ‘The horrible monotony of his career<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
stupefies the mind until it is ready to accept the
principle of evil as the fundamental law of the
land.’ Motley’s conclusion is that Philip the Second
of Spain was Machiavelli’s greatest pupil.</p>

<p>What remains of the book after Philip’s death
lacks neither literary interest nor historic value.
But we have something akin to the feeling which
comes over us when the chief character in a play
dies before the last act; we question for a moment
whether the interest will hold. That dominant and
sinister personality leaves a void which the exploits
of Prince Maurice hardly serve to fill. With these
exploits, however, and a discussion of the causes
leading to the Twelve Years’ Truce, Motley concluded
the <i>History of the United Netherlands</i>.</p>

<p>In the last of his three great works, <i>John of
Barneveld</i>, Motley gave full expression to his generous
partisanship of all that seemed to him to
stand for the spirit of liberty. With a contempt
for the subtleties of theological speculation, the
historian was by instinct ‘Remonstrant,’ that is,
anti-Calvinistic, and found in Barneveld one of
his heroes. He has painted a wonderful picture
of the old advocate’s trial and death. Hounded
daily by twenty-four judges, many of them his
personal enemies, compelled to rely on his powerful
memory in reviewing the events and explaining the
acts of his forty-three years of public service,
denied books, denied counsel, denied a knowledge
in advance of the charges made against him, denied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
access to the notes of his examination as it proceeded,
denied everything suggested by the words
‘law’ and ‘justice,’ Barneveld came out of the
ordeal so triumphantly that the announcement of
his sentence might well have moved him to say:
‘I am ready enough to die, but I cannot comprehend
why I am to die.’</p>

<p>In characterization of men, in searching analysis
of causes and motives, in brilliant description, and
in manly eloquence, Motley’s <i>John of Barneveld</i>
equals its predecessors, while the note of passion
is if anything intensified by the bitter experiences
through which the historian had so recently passed.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>A fitting postlude to Motley’s work as a whole
may be found in the last sentence of the <i>United
Netherlands</i>. It makes clear the motives other
than scholarly and creative which led to the writing
of these splendid narratives. Says the historian:
‘If by his labors a generous love has been
fostered for that blessing, without which everything
that this earth can afford is worthless,—freedom
of thought, of speech, and of life,—his
highest wish has been fulfilled.’</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Parkmans are descendants of Thomas
Parkman of Sidmouth, Devon, whose son
Elias settled in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in
1633. Francis Parkman was a son of the Reverend
Francis Parkman, pastor for thirty-six years of the
New North Church in Boston. Through his mother,
Caroline (Hall) Parkman, he was related to
the famous colonial minister, John Cotton. Two
of his maternal ancestors used to preach to the
Indians in their own tongue. Parkman’s deep interest
in the ‘aborigines’ may have been ‘partly
inherited from these Puritan ancestors.’ ‘It does
not appear, however, that he ever learned their
language, and it may be regarded as certain that
he never preached to them.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span></p>

<p>Born in Boston on September 16, 1823, Parkman
prepared for college at Chauncy Hall School
and was graduated at Harvard in 1844. During
his college course he ‘showed symptoms of Injuns
on the brain,’ as a classmate phrased it. In 1841
he began those vacation wanderings which gave
him such an intimate acquaintance with the
American wilderness. Before taking his degree he
had planned a book on the conspiracy of Pontiac.
The year after graduation he visited Detroit and
other scenes of the historic drama, collected papers,
and, wherever it was possible, ‘interviewed descendants
of the actors.’</p>

<p>At his father’s instance Parkman then entered
the Dane Law School at Cambridge and obtained
his degree (1846), but took no steps to be admitted
to the bar. He studied by himself history,
Indian ethnology, and ‘models of English style.’
The passage in <i>Vassall Morton</i> describing the influence
of Thierry’s <i>Norman Conquest</i> in directing
the hero of the novel towards ethnological study,
is thought to be autobiographical.</p>

<p>Having weakened his sight by immoderate
reading, Parkman (in 1846) made a journey to the
Northwest, ‘partly to cure his eyes and partly to
study Indian life.’ He was accompanied by his
friend Quincy Adams Shaw. For some weeks he
lived in a village of Ogillallah Indians, sharing the
tent of a chief and following the wanderings of
the tribe in their search for enemies and buffalo.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
The hardships of the life ruined his health. His
sight was made worse rather than better, and his first
book, <i>The Oregon Trail</i> (1849), describing these
western experiences, had to be written from dictation.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
It was followed by <i>The Conspiracy of Pontiac</i>
(1851), and that by <i>Vassall Morton</i> (1856), an
attempt at fiction. This ends the initial period of
Parkman’s literary life.</p>

<p>In 1850 Parkman married Catharine, a daughter
of Doctor Jacob Bigelow of Boston. She is said
to have been a woman of a sweet and joyful disposition,
having a keen sense of humor, and, above
all, endowed with ‘the high courage requisite to
tend unfalteringly the pain and suffering of the
man she loved.’<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> It was a perfect union, but
unhappily it was not to last long. Mrs. Parkman
died in 1858.</p>

<p>The historian’s health steadily declined. For
years together his chief study was to keep himself
alive. As a part of this study he took up
floriculture, and soon found himself absorbed in
it for its own sake. He became famous for his
roses and lilies, and was the recipient of prizes
innumerable from horticultural societies.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> Yet at
no time did he lose sight of his main object, the
history of France in North America. Little by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
little his store of materials accumulated. Even
when he was at his worst physically, some progress
was made. It might be only a step, but the
step had not to be retraced.</p>

<p>As his strength returned he began to travel. To
renew his acquaintance with the Indians he went
to Fort Snelling in 1867. He was repeatedly in
Paris consulting archives and doctors. He visited
Canada in 1873 and explored over and over again
the region between Quebec and Lake George.</p>

<p>The great historical series to which its author
gave the title of <i>France and England in North
America</i> began to appear just at the close of the
Civil War. The volumes in the order of their
publication are: <i>The Pioneers of France in the
New World</i>, 1865; <i>The Jesuits in North America</i>,
1867; <i>The Discovery of the Great West</i>, 1869;<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
<i>The Old Régime</i>, 1874; <i>Count Frontenac and New
France under Louis XIV</i>, 1877; <i>Montcalm and
Wolfe</i>, 1884; <i>A Half-Century of Conflict</i>, 1892.</p>

<p>The merits of this extraordinary series were
recognized at once as many and varied. It is a
question to which of three types of reader the
books most appealed,—the scholar, who is bound
to read critically whether he will or no, the utilitarian
in search of facts chiefly, or the mere lover
of literature. Each found what he was seeking
in these narratives, and each paid homage to the
author in his own way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span></p>

<p>As is often true of historians far less notable
than he, Parkman was the recipient of academic
honors, and was made a member of numerous
historical societies. The mere catalogue of these
distinctions fills a page of printed text. His membership
of the Massachusetts Historical Society
and his degree of LL. D. from Harvard College
(1889) will serve as illustrations. Parkman was
influential in helping to found the Archæological
Institute of America. He was one of the founders
of the St. Botolph Club in Boston, and its president
during the first six years of its existence.</p>

<p>The history of France and England in North
America was completed the year before he died.
Had time and strength been allowed him, he
would have recast the material in the form of
a continuous narrative. There might have been a
gain in the new arrangement, as on the other hand
there might have been a loss.</p>

<p>Parkman died at his home at Jamaica Plain,
near Boston, on November 8, 1893.</p>

<h3 id="sec_77">II<br />

<span class="subhead">PARKMAN’S CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Parkman</span> had prodigious will power and unequalled
pertinacity. No barrier to the accomplishment
of his object was allowed to stand in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
the way. He was beset by the demons of ill
health, and their number was legion. Unable to
rout them by impetuous onslaught, he tired them
out, thinning their ranks, one by one. He was
infinitely patient, full of devices for outwitting the
enemy. Beaten again and again, he stubbornly
renewed the fight. Threatened with blindness,
he set himself to avoid it, and did. Threatened
with insanity, he declined to become insane.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more admirable than the
spirit in which he faced daily torment. He was
that extraordinary being, a cheerful stoic. Four
times in his life it was a question whether he would
live or die. Parkman admitted that once, had he
been seeking merely his comfort, he would have
elected to die. That must have been the time
when, in response to his physician’s encouraging
remark that he had a strong constitution, Parkman
said: ‘I’m afraid I have.’ In ordinary conditions
of ill health he was bright, cheery, philosophical,
but when he suffered most he was silent. At no
time was he capable of complaining.</p>

<p>Parkman loved to face the hard facts of life and
was apt to admire others in the degree in which
they showed a like spirit. He had a sovereign
contempt for everything not manly and robust.
He contradicted with amusing emphasis the statement
in some biographical notice that he was
‘feeble.’ By his philosophy the militant attitude
toward life was the true one. He believed in war<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
as a moral force; it made for character both in the
man and in the nation. ‘The severest disappointment
of his life was his inability to enter the army
during our civil war.’</p>

<p>He was wholly free from certain narrow traits
which are too apt to be engendered in a life devoted
to books and authorship. Manly, open-hearted,
unspoiled, he neither craved honors nor
despised them. It has been remarked that while
he was gratified by the recognition accorded his
work in high places, he was equally pleased with
a letter from ‘a live boy’ who wrote to tell him
how much he had enjoyed reading about Pontiac
and La Salle. He himself kept to the last a certain
boyish frankness of mind and heart. The
year before he died he wrote to the secretary of
the class of ’44: ‘Please give my kind regrets and
remembrances to the fellows.’</p>

<p>There have been not a few attractive personalities
in the history of American letters. Parkman
was one of the most attractive among them.</p>

<h3 id="sec_78">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WRITER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> style is clear and luminous. Short sentences
abound, giving the effect of rapidity. The mind
of the reader never halts because of an obscure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
term or some intricacy of structure. Neither is
the page spotted with long words ending in <i>tion</i>,
and which coming in groups, as they do in Bancroft,
are like grit in the teeth. Parkman did not
attain the exquisite grace and composure which
characterize Irving’s prose, but he came nearer to
it than did Prescott. The historian of Ferdinand
and Isabella had a self-conscious style. Agreeable
as it is, it reveals a man always on guard as he
writes. In his most eloquent passages Prescott is
formal, precise, even stiff.</p>

<p>Parkman’s style is wholly engaging. There is
a captivating manner about it, the result of his
immense enthusiasm for his theme. Infinitely laborious
in the preparation, sceptical in use of authorities,
temperate in judgment, when, however,
it comes to telling the story, he allows his genius
for narration a free rein, and the style, though
losing none of its dignity, is eager and almost impetuous.
The historian speaks as an eye-witness
of all he describes.</p>

<p>This explains Parkman’s popularity in large
degree. Fascinating as the subject is, the manner
adds a hundred fold. He who reads Bancroft gets
a deal of information, for which he pays a round
price. He who reads Parkman gets facts, eloquence,
philosophy, besides no end of adventure,
and for all this he pays literally nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_79">IV<br />

<span class="subhead">EARLY WORK</span>

<span class="subhead"><i>OREGON TRAIL</i>, <i>CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC</i>,
<i>VASSALL MORTON</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><i>The Oregon Trail</i> ranks high among books which,
though sometimes written for quite another purpose,
are read chiefly for entertainment. Such was
<i>Two Years before the Mast</i>, such was <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>, that skilful work of a most accomplished
poseur.</p>

<p>In addition to its value as literature, <i>The Oregon
Trail</i> is a trustworthy account of a no longer
existent state of society. It is a document. The
range of experience was narrow, and the adventures
few, but so far as it goes the record is perfect;
and when read in connection with his historical
work, the book becomes a commentary on Parkman’s
method. Here is shown how he got that
knowledge of Indian life and character which distinguishes
his work from that of other historical
writers who touch the same field. The knowledge
was utilized at once in his next work.</p>

<p><i>The Conspiracy of Pontiac</i> is the sort of book
people praise by saying that it is as readable as a
novel. The comparison is unfortunate. So many
novels are disciplinary rather than amusing. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
wishes it were possible to say of them that they
are as readable as history.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it is quite true that the virtues
supposed to inhere chiefly in a work of fiction
are conspicuous in this the first of Parkman’s
historical studies. <i>The Conspiracy of Pontiac</i> is a
story, filled with incident and abounding in illustrations
of courage, craft, endurance, stubbornness,
self-sacrifice, despair, triumph. The plain truth
shames invention. Pontiac lives in these pages
describing his towering ambition. So do the other
actors,—Rogers, Gladwyn, Campbell, Catharine
the Ojibwa girl. The supernumeraries are strikingly
picturesque,—Canadian settlers, trappers,
coureurs des bois, priests, half-breeds, and Indians,
the motley denizens of frontier and wilderness.
A forest drama played by actors like these is bound
to be absorbing were it only as a spectacle.</p>

<p>One fact becomes apparent on taking up this
book. History as Parkman writes it is both dramatic
and graphical, filled with action and movement,
filled with color, form, and beauty. With
such an eye for effect it is impossible for him to
be dull. Open the volume at random and the
wealth of the author’s observations seems to have
been showered on that page. But the next page
is like it, and also the next.</p>

<p>The vivacity of youth explains much in this
narrative. Parkman was but twenty-six when he
wrote <i>The Conspiracy of Pontiac</i>. Being young, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
was not afraid to be eloquent, to revel in descriptions
of sunrise and sunset, tempests, the coming
of spring, the brilliant hues of autumn foliage,
the soft haze of Indian summer. His chapters
are richly enamelled with these glowing pieces
of rhetoric. He is no less brilliant in his martial
scenes; the accounts of the Battle of Bloody
Bridge and of Bouquet’s fight in the forest are
extraordinarily well done.</p>

<p>The historian is severe on writers who have
idealized the Indian. Here is one of Parkman’s
own characterizations: ‘The stern, unchanging
features of his mind excite our admiration from
their very immutability; and we look with deep
interest on the fate of this irreclaimable son of
the wilderness, the child who will not be weaned
from the breast of his rugged mother. And our
interest increases when we discern in the unhappy
wanderer, mingled among his vices, the
germs of heroic virtues,—a hand bountiful to
bestow, as it is rapacious to seize, and, even in
extremest famine, imparting its last morsel to a
fellow sufferer; a heart which, strong in friendship
as in hate, thinks it not too much to lay
down life for its chosen comrade; a soul true
to its own idea of honor, and burning with an
unquenchable thirst for greatness and renown.’
Neither poet nor novelist really needs to embroider
such an account of the Red Man.</p>

<p>This successful historic monograph was followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
by an unsuccessful novel, written, it is thought,
for recreation. Without being an autobiography,
<i>Vassall Morton</i> abounds in autobiographical passages.
Its failure was not of the kind that proves
inability ever to master the art of fiction. The
loss to American letters however would have been
incalculable had Parkman’s genius for historical
narrative been sacrificed in any degree to novel
writing. And this might have happened had
<i>Vassall Morton</i> been a success.</p>

<h3 id="sec_80">V<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>FRANCE AND ENGLAND IN NORTH
AMERICA</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> history of France in North America abounds
in everything appealing to the love of the heroic.
Parkman writes in a spirit of frank and contagious
admiration. Himself of Puritan blood and appreciative
of the best in Puritan character, he makes
the pale narratives of the contentious little English
republics seem colorless indeed when laid beside
his glowing pages. The great warriors, the brave
and fanatical priests, the adventurous rangers, and
the iron-hearted explorers of New France were
born to be wondered at and extolled. Without
assuming that these men had a monopoly of virtue,
Parkman scatters praise with a free hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span></p>

<p>The germ of this massive and beautiful work
is contained in the introductory chapters of <i>Pontiac</i>.
Here is outlined the history of French exploration,
religious propagandism, and military conquest or
defeat up to the fall of Quebec.</p>

<p>The first three narratives (<i>The Pioneers of
France</i>, <i>The Jesuits</i>, and <i>La Salle</i>) cover the period
of inception. They abound in illustrations of
heroism, self-sacrifice, and missionary fervor. The
last three volumes (<i>Count Frontenac</i>, <i>A Half-Century
of Conflict</i>, and <i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i>) describe
the struggle of rival powers for supremacy. They
are characterized mainly by illustrations of commercial
greed, ecclesiastical jealousy, personal and
political ambition. Midway in the series and related
alike to what precedes and what follows is
the fascinating volume, <i>The Old Régime in Canada</i>.</p>

<p>The title of the initial volume, <i>The Pioneers of
France in the New World</i>, exactly describes it. The
‘Pioneers’ are the Basque, the Norman, and the
Breton sailors who, from an almost unrecorded
past, crossed the sea yearly to fish on the banks
of Newfoundland. They are Jacques Cartier of
St. Malo, who first explored the St. Lawrence,
Roberval, La Roche, and De Monts. Men of
their time, they were both devout and unscrupulous.
Among them and their followers were grim
humorists. When, after the arrival of De Monts’s
company in Acadia, a priest and a Huguenot minister
died at the same time, the crew buried them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
in one grave ‘to see if they would lie peaceably
together.’</p>

<p>Chief among the great names of this period is
that of Samuel Champlain, the ‘life’ of New
France, who united in himself ‘the crusader, the
romance-loving explorer, the curious, knowledge-seeking
traveller, the practical navigator.’ Such
a man has a breadth of vision and strength of
purpose in comparison with which the sight of
common men is blindness and their strength infirmity.</p>

<p>The second narrative in the series, <i>The Jesuits
in North America</i>, is an amazing record of courage,
fanaticism, indomitable will, perseverance, and
martyrdom. The book contains the gist of the
famous <i>Jesuit Relations</i>. A man may be forgiven
for not wearying himself with the tediousness of
those good fathers who were often as long-winded
as they were brave. But he is inexcusable if he
has not learned to admire them through Parkman’s
thrilling account of their physical sufferings
and spiritual triumphs. Those giants of devotion,
Brébeuf, Lalemant, Garnier, and Jogues, seem both
human and superhuman as they move across the
stage of history.</p>

<p>In <i>La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West</i>
we have a story of zeal of another sort. La Salle
is a pathetic figure. Yet to pity him were to offer
insult. He stood apart from his fellows, misunderstood
and maligned, but self-centred and self-sufficient.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
His contemporaries thought him crack-brained;
suffering had turned his head. They
mocked his schemes and denied the truth of the
discoveries to which he laid claim. His history is
one of pure disaster. But no one of Parkman’s
heroes awakens greater sympathy than this silent
man who found in the pursuit of honor compensation
enough for incredible fatigues and sacrifices.</p>

<p><i>The Old Régime in Canada</i> treats of the contest
between the feudal chiefs of Acadia, La Tour and
D’Aunay, of the mission among the Iroquois, of
the career of that imperious churchman Laval, and
then, in a hundred and fifty brilliant pages, of
Canadian civilization in the Seventeenth Century.
This section is a model of instructive and stimulating
writing, grateful alike to the student of
manners and to the amateur of literary delights.</p>

<p>The last volume shows the construction of the
‘political and social machine.’ The next, <i>Count
Frontenac and New France</i>, shows the ‘machine
in action.’ The period covered is from 1672 to
1698. Frontenac’s collision with the order which
controlled the spiritual destinies of New France
led to his recall in 1682. La Barre, who succeeded
Frontenac, was a failure. Denonville, the next governor,
could live amicably with the Jesuits, but
religious fervor proved no substitute for tact in
dealing with the savages. There was need of a
man who could handle both Jesuits and Indians.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
At seventy years of age Frontenac returned to
prop the tottering fortunes of New France. One
learns to like the irascible old governor who was
vastly jealous of his dignity, but who, when the
need was, could take a tomahawk and dance a
war-dance to the great admiration of the Indians
and to the political benefit of New France.</p>

<p>The story of the struggle for supremacy is continued
in <i>A Half-Century of Conflict</i>.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> That phase
of the record relating to the border forays is almost
monotonous in its unvarying details of ambuscade,
murder, the torture-stake, and captivity.
The French and their Indian allies descended on
the outlying settlements of New England with
fire, sword, and tomahawk. Deerfield was sacked,
and the country harried far and wide.</p>

<p>In the mean time French explorers were advancing
west and south. Some, in their eagerness to
anticipate the English, established posts in Louisiana.
Others, with a courage peculiar to the time
rather than to any one race, pushed beyond the
Missouri to Colorado and New Mexico, to Dakota
and Montana, led on by mixed motives such as
personal ambition, love of gain, patriotism.</p>

<p>A spectacular event of the period was the siege
and capture of Louisbourg by a force largely composed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
of New England farmers and fishermen.
The project was conceived in audacity and carried
out with astonishing dash and good humor.
That was singular military enterprise which in the
mind of an eye-witness bore some resemblance to
a ‘Cambridge Commencement.’ ‘While the cannon
bellowed in the front,’ says Parkman, ‘frolic
and confusion reigned at the camp, where the
men raced, wrestled, pitched quoits, and ...
ran after French cannon balls, which were carried
to the batteries to be returned to those who sent
them.’</p>

<p>The volumes entitled <i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i> crown
the work. With stores of erudition, a finely tempered
judgment, a practised pen, and taste refined
by thirty years’ search for the manliest and most
becoming forms of expression, Parkman gave himself
to the writing of this his masterpiece. The
work is the longest as well as the best of the seven
parts. Every page, from the account of Céloron
de Bienville’s journey to the Ohio to the story of
the fall of Quebec, is crowded with fact, suggestion,
eloquence. The texture of the narrative is close
knit. The early volumes are often disjointed.
They resemble groups of essays. Chapters are so
completely a unit that they might be read by
themselves with little regard to what preceded or
what was to follow. Not so the <i>Montcalm and
Wolfe</i>, which is a perfectly homogeneous piece of
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span></p>

<p>This series of narratives has extraordinary
merits. Let us note a few of them.</p>

<p>Among Parkman’s virtues as a historian are
clarity of view, a singularly unbiased attitude, an
eye for the picturesque which never fails to seize
on the essentials of form, color, and grouping, extraordinary
power of condensation, a firm grasp
of details, together with the ability to subordinate
all details to the main purpose. But other historians
have had these same virtues; we must find
something more distinctive.</p>

<p>History as Parkman conceived it cannot be
based on books and documents alone. The historian
must identify himself with the men of the
past, live their life, think their thoughts, place
himself so far as possible at their point of view.
Since he cannot talk with them, he must at least
talk with their descendants. But the nature of
the ‘habitant’ cannot be studied in the latitude
of Boston, it must be studied on the St. Lawrence.
A city covers the site of ancient Hochelaga, nevertheless
the historian must go there, and under the
same sky, with many features of the landscape
unchanged, reconstruct Hochelaga as it was when
Jacques Cartier’s eyes rested upon it in 1535. This
indicates Parkman’s method. When he visited a
battle-field it was not as one who aimed at mere
mathematical correctness of description, but as an
artist whose imagination took fire at the sight
of a historic spot, and who had there a vision of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
the past such as would not come to him in his
library.</p>

<p>Would we see Parkman in a characteristic rôle
we should not go to his literary workshop, but for
example to the little town of Utica, Illinois. There
one summer night, sitting on the porch of the
hotel, Parkman described to a group of farmers
gathered about, the location of La Salle’s fort and
of the great Indian town. The description was
based on what he had learned from books ‘nearly
two hundred years old.’ His improvised audience
gave hearty assent to its accuracy. Parkman was
there to obtain accuracy of another sort. The next
day he visited all the localities which formed the
background of the historic drama and reconstructed
the life of the time. This is but one instance
among hundreds which might be brought forward
to show the pains he took. Herein lay the distinctive
feature of his method. He used imagination
not to embroider the facts of history, but to
give to dead facts a new life. A faculty of the mind
which is supposed to vitiate history becomes in
Parkman’s hands a means for arriving at truth.</p>

<p>Parkman was a fortunate man. He was happy
in his choice of a subject. The theme was a great
one, worthy the pen of so profound a scholar and
so gifted a literary artist. To this theme he gave
his life, working with singleness of purpose and
under incredible difficulties. No trace of this suffering
can be detected in the temper of his judgments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
or in the even flow and bright radiance
of his narrative. He was not only happy in his
mastery of his subject, he was most happy in his
mastery of himself. Parkman’s life is a reproach
to the man who, working amid normal conditions
of health and fortune, permits himself to complain
that there are difficulties in his way.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Bayard Taylor</span> in 1841, when he was sixteen,
contributed to the Philadelphia ‘Saturday
Evening Post’ the verses entitled ‘Soliloquy of
a Young Poet.’ In 1878, the year of his death, he
was still planning new literary enterprises, and in
so far as declining health permitted, carrying them
out. If unwearied devotion through nearly forty
years to the literary life, great fecundity in production,
much taste, no little scholarship, and unquestioned
sincerity in the exercise of his art entitle
one to be called by the honorable name of man of
letters, who is more deserving than the author of
<i>The Masque of the Gods</i>? To be sure, only a few
of his many books are read. But Taylor is in no
worse case than many men who tower giant-fashion
above him. They likewise have written forty volumes
and are known and measured by two or three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span></p>

<p>Taylor was partly of German, partly of English
Quaker stock, and could boast an ancestor (Robert
Taylor) who had come to America with William
Penn. The fourth of the ten children of Joseph
and Rebecca (Way) Taylor, he was born at Kennett
Square, Pennsylvania, on January 11, 1825.
His education was got at the neighboring academies
of Westchester and Unionville. He was a
rhymester at the age of seven, and had become an
industrious writer by the time he was twelve.</p>

<p>Having no inclination towards school-teaching
and still less towards his father’s vocation, farming,
Taylor was apprenticed to a printer. He was presently
seized with a passion for travel, and in 1844,
with one hundred and forty dollars in his pocket,
payment in advance for certain letters he was to
write for Philadelphia journals, he set out on a pedestrian
tour of Europe. He had a few remittances
from home. Greeley promised to print some of his
letters provided they were ‘not descriptive’ and
that before writing them the young traveller made
sure that he had been in Europe ‘long enough to
know something.’ Seventeen of Taylor’s letters
appeared in the ‘Tribune.’</p>

<p>By rigid economy Taylor managed to get on.
But one must have youth to endure the hardships
of such a journey. Especially must one have youth
if he proposes, as Taylor did, to walk from Marseilles
to Paris in the cold winter rains. The history
of these two years of wandering is recounted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
in <i>Views Afoot, or Europe seen with Knapsack and
Staff</i> (1846).</p>

<p>Taylor returned to America and took up journalism.
Failing in an attempt to make of the ‘Phœnixville
Pioneer’ a paper according to his ideal,
he went to New York (December, 1847). After
various experiences he secured a place on the ‘Tribune,’
was rapidly advanced, and became in time
a stockholder. He was sent to California to report
on the gold discoveries. This journey furnished
him with the matter for his second book of travel,
<i>El Dorado, or Adventures in the Path of Empire</i>
(1850).</p>

<p>His whole subsequent career is but a variation
on the themes of 1846 and 1850. He went
everywhere,—to Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Asia
Minor (1851–52); to Spain and India, then on to
China, where he joined Perry’s expedition to Japan
(1853). He was in Germany, Norway, and Lapland
in 1856, in Greece in 1857–58, in Russia in
1862–63 (where for a while he held the post of
secretary of legation), in Switzerland, the Pyrenees,
and Corsica in 1868, and in Egypt and Iceland in
the same year (1874).</p>

<p>All his adventures were transmuted into books:
<i>A Journey to Central Africa</i>, 1854; <i>The Lands of
the Saracen</i>, 1854; <i>A Visit to India, China, and
Japan in the Year 1853</i>, 1855; <i>Northern Travel</i>,
1857; <i>Travels in Greece and Russia</i>, 1859; <i>At
Home and Abroad</i>, 1859; <i>At Home and Abroad</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
‘second series,’ 1862; <i>Colorado</i>, 1867; <i>By-Ways
of Europe</i>, 1869; <i>Egypt and Iceland</i>, 1874.</p>

<p>A part of the great success of these books was
due to causes far from literature. Doubtless, if
written to-day, the volumes would be read, but it
were idle to suppose that they could have the
vogue they enjoyed in the Fifties. The American
public of a half-century ago was not nomadic. It
had few ways of gratifying its thirst for knowledge
of foreign lands. Photographs were so expensive
that one seldom ran the risk of being obliged to
sit down with a friend ‘just back from Europe’ to
admire such novelties as the Leaning Tower and
the Bridge of Sighs. The oxyhydrogen stereopticon
was imperfect, the panorama clumsy and ill-painted.
Therefore the writings of a man who had
the knack of telling agreeably what he had seen
were most welcome. The home-keeping public
enjoyed also hearing the traveller talk. When
Taylor lectured (for he became one of the most
popular lecturers of the day) they crowded the hall
and thought two hours of him not long enough.</p>

<p>Timeliness, however, does not explain all the
success of <i>Views Afoot</i> and its companion volumes.
Taylor was an excellent writer even when
he wrote most hastily. If his word-pictures were
often highly colored, they possessed, among other
virtues, the great virtue of having been painted
on the spot. Through their aid one could really
see what Taylor had himself seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span></p>

<p>But Taylor was a poet before he was a traveller.
In 1844 he published (under the patronage
of R. W. Griswold, his first literary adviser) a
little volume entitled <i>Ximena, or, The Battle of the
Sierra Morena, and Other Poems</i>. It was followed
by <i>Rhymes of Travel</i> (1848) and <i>The American
Legend</i>, the Phi Beta Kappa poem at Harvard
(1850). To these must be added <i>A Book of Romances,
Lyrics, and Songs</i>, 1851; <i>Poems and Ballads</i>,
1854; <i>Poems of the Orient</i>, 1854; <i>Poems of Home
and Travel</i>, 1855; <i>The Poet’s Journal</i>, 1862;
<i>The Picture of St. John</i>, 1866; <i>The Masque of
the Gods</i>, 1872; <i>Lars</i>, 1873; <i>The Prophet</i>, 1874;
<i>Home Pastorals, Ballads, and Lyrics</i>, 1875; <i>The
National Ode</i> (read by the author at the opening
of the ‘Centennial’), 1876; and <i>Prince Deukalion</i>,
1878. The great translation of Goethe’s <i>Faust</i>,
with the commentary, appeared in 1870–71.</p>

<p>Not content with his commercial success as a
writer of travels, and his artistic triumphs in
poetry, Taylor tried fiction. The first of his four
novels, <i>Hannah Thurston</i> (1863), is in part a satire
and shows in their most disagreeable light the
people who abhor meat and swear by vegetables,
the people who profess to hold communication
with spirits, the people who think other people
ought not to buy and sell human flesh, and so
forth.</p>

<p><i>John Godfrey’s Fortunes</i> (1864) embodies not a
few of Taylor’s journalistic experiences in New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
York. Here are glimpses of literary society such
as the soirées at the home of Estelle Ann Lewis,
the Mademoiselle de Scudéry of that time and
place. <i>The Story of Kennett</i> (1866) is a Pennsylvanian
study, a true and lively picture of a phase
of civilization which the author perfectly understood.
<i>Joseph and his Friend</i> (1870) closed the
series of efforts by which Taylor tried to earn
money enough to free him from the thraldom of
the lecture platform.</p>

<p>His other publications were <i>Beauty and the
Beast, and Tales of Home</i> (1872), <i>The Echo Club</i>
(1876), the posthumous <i>Studies in German Literature</i>
(1879), and <i>Essays and Studies</i> (1880).</p>

<p>Of Taylor’s private life a few important facts
remain to be recorded. The pathetic story of
Mary Agnew, the beautiful girl whom he had
loved since they were school-children together,
and whom he married on her death-bed, is a
romance which fortunately has been well told by
both of Taylor’s biographers. In 1857 (seven
years after Mary Agnew’s death) Taylor married
Marie Hansen, daughter of Professor Hansen of
Gotha, the astronomer. How devoted and helpful
she was to him during his arduous life, and
how loyal to his memory, are facts too well
known to require emphasis.</p>

<p>The home at Kennett known as ‘Cedarcroft’
was built in 1859–60. Taylor lavished on it both
money and affection; and while for a few years it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
gave him a deal of happiness, it proved in the end
a burden he could ill afford to carry.</p>

<p>Robust and vigorous though he seemed in
middle life, Taylor by unremitting activity had
sapped his powers. He gave no evidence of declining
literary ambition, but at fifty he was worn
out by overwork. A notable recognition of his
worth came to him in 1878, when President
Hayes appointed him Minister to Germany. He
was not to enjoy the honor for long. In May,
1878, he took up the duties of his office, and on
the fifteenth of the following December he died
while sitting in his armchair in his library.</p>

<h3 id="sec_82">II<br />

<span class="subhead">HIS CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Ambition</span> was a ruling motive in Taylor’s life.
Yet there has seldom been an ambition which, albeit
as consuming as fire, was at the same time so
free from selfish and ignoble elements.</p>

<p>Taylor aspired to fame through cultivation of
the art of poesy. This was the real object of his
life. To gain this object he toiled unceasingly and
made innumerable sacrifices. Baffled in the attempt
to reach his ideal, he was a little comforted when
he could persuade himself that he had not fallen
completely short of it. And there was exceeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
great reward in the knowledge that if wide recognition
as a poet was denied him, his friends, Whittier,
Longfellow, Stoddard, Boker, and Aldrich,
knew for what he was striving and commended him
in no uncertain tones.</p>

<p>Whittier described Taylor as one who loved
‘old friends, old ways, and kept his boyhood’s
dreams in sight.’ Life was intensely interesting to
Taylor. Although the zest of travel disappeared
and his large experience of the ways of men had had
its customary disillusioning effect, he never really
lost his youthful enthusiasm. And it is touching
to find in his private correspondence the repeated
proofs of how inexhaustible was his fund of hope
and of courage, and how quick he was to recover
after real or fancied defeat.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his successes, and he had his
share of the good things of life,—contemporary
reputation, money of his own earning, and friends,—Bayard
Taylor remains, with all his manly
qualities, a somewhat pathetic figure in American
letters. He led a restless and turbulent mental
existence, and died the victim of ambition and overwork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_83">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE ARTIST</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Taylor</span> has been pronounced the most skilful of
our metrists after Longfellow. One illustration
only can be given of his interest in the mechanism
of verse, and that is his poetic romance <i>The Picture
of St. John</i>. The poem was not published until
sixteen years after its first conception. Possibly
its growth was a little retarded by the structural
peculiarities.</p>

<p>The poem contains three hundred and fifty-five
eight-line stanzas (iambic pentameter) grouped
into four books. The ‘ottava rima’ was chosen
as ‘better adapted for the purposes of a romantic
epic than either the Spenserian stanza<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> or the
heroic couplet.’ But the question with the poet
was,—how to avoid the ‘uniform sweetness’ of a
regular stanza while obtaining the ‘proper compactness
and strength of rhythm’ which (in his
belief) only a stanza could give. His device was to
allow himself freedom of rhyme within the stanza,
and this ‘not to escape the laws which Poetry imposes,’
but rather to impose a different law in the
hope that the form would ‘more readily reflect the
varying moods.’ When finally the poem was finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
Taylor found that the three hundred and
fifty-five stanzas contained ‘more than seventy
variations in the order of rhyme.’</p>

<p>Only an enthusiast in the study of form would
have undertaken the task of reproducing <i>Faust</i> in
the original metres. Taylor’s success was so great
that his work as a translator has obscured his fame
as a poet. Doubtless so nearly perfect a version
had been impossible without that wonderful grasp
of the spirit of the original. But it must not be
forgotten how much it owes to the years of study
and practice Taylor gave to the technique of his
art.</p>

<h3 id="sec_84">IV<br />

<span class="subhead">POETICAL WORK</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">In</span> 1855 Taylor published a selection from his
earlier books of verse under the title <i>Poems of
Home and Travel</i>. By this volume and its companion,
<i>Poems of the Orient</i>, he wished, so he said
at the time, to be judged. For all his other pieces
he desired ‘speedy forgetfulness.’</p>

<p><i>Poems of Home and Travel</i> shows very well the
range of Taylor’s art. Here are rhymed stories
(‘The Soldier and the Pard’ and ‘Kubleh’),
graceful settings of classic or Indian legend (‘Hylas’
and ‘Mon-da-Min’), together with a pretty
fancy from Shakespeare (‘Ariel in the Cloven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
Pine’). A deeper chord is struck in poems of
human love and loss (‘The Two Visions’) and in
poems expressing aspiration for the ideal (‘Love
and Solitude’), or in those which voice the
poet’s joy in a life of action and struggle (‘The
Life of Earth’ and ‘Taurus’). There is an ode,
‘The Harp,’ lamenting the silence of song in our
America where there is so much to sing. And
there are yet other odes, songs, and sonnets.</p>

<p><i>Poems of the Orient</i> is a typical volume, full of
color, warmth, light, breathing the intoxication and
glowing with the fantasy of that great vague region
we call ‘the East.’ The charm of the verses is very
pronounced. How much of what we relish in the
volume is really the spirit of the East can best
be told by one who knows both the East and
the poems. Oriental lyrics and romances would be
written otherwise to-day. Taylor was partly under
the thrall of that roseate view of the Orient held
by Thomas Moore and his contemporaries. Sir
Richard Burton has popularized a more realistic
conception in which love and roses are less prominent.
The flavor of <i>Poems of the Orient</i> may be
known by such pieces as ‘The Temptation of
Hassan Ben Khaled,’ ‘Amran’s Wooing’ (an
Oriental version of young Lochinvar), ‘El Khalil,’
‘Desert Hymn to the Sun,’ and the popular
‘Bedouin Song.’</p>

<p><i>The Poet’s Journal</i>, a group of twenty-nine lyrics
connected by a poetic narrative and divided into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
First, Second, and Third Evenings, is plainly autobiographical.
Its varying moods of despair and
dumb grief, followed by the stirrings of hope and
ambition, and, under the influence of awakened
love, the triumph of the spirit to will and to do,
connect it with the most intimate passages in
Taylor’s life.</p>

<p><i>The Picture of St. John</i>, an Italian romance,
seems made for a popularity it somehow never
attained. The worldly ambition of the artist transfigured
by love, the death of the highborn girl
who sacrifices wealth and pride of place for her
lover, the unwitting murder of her child by his
grandsire, and the redemption of the artist after
months of conflict with the Power that Denies—these
are elements in a work on which the poet
lavished the best of his gifts.</p>

<p><i>Lars</i>, a Scandinavian study, an idyl of the vales
and fiords of Norway, illustrates Taylor’s cosmopolitanism.
Passionately as he loved the South, he
could also exclaim with Ruth,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">The hearts unspoiled, though fed from ruder times</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And filled with angry blood.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Home Pastorals, Ballads, and Lyrics</i> contains
his fine studies of Westchester County life, ‘The
Quaker Widow,’ ‘John Reed,’ and ‘The Old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
Pennsylvania Farmer,’ together with such happily
conceived poems as ‘The Sunshine of the
Gods,’ ‘Notus Ignoto,’ ‘Iris,’ ‘Implora Pace,’
and ‘Canopus,’ with its richly colored lines.</p>

<p>Taylor wrote three dramatic poems, none of
which his critics are willing to admit is a success.
<i>The Masque of the Gods</i>, a lofty conception, fails
(if indeed it is a failure), not through feebleness
of touch, but through brevity. So vast a design
needs room to expand. As it stands, the <i>Masque</i>
is a preliminary sketch of what might have become
in the hands of its creator a great canvas.
It is something that the poet has succeeded in
awakening pity for the worn-out deities terrified
because of their loss of power, terrified even more
by the possibility that they have no principle of
life and are only the creatures of men’s brains.</p>

<p><i>The Prophet</i> was a courageous dramatic experiment,
and will always be read with curiosity if not
with pleasure. But to assume that Mormonism is
wholly unfitted for poetic drama is perhaps to assume
too much.</p>

<p><i>Prince Deukalion</i>, written under the inspiration
of <i>Faust</i>, is another of those gigantic conceptions
with which Taylor’s imagination loved in later life
to busy itself, as if eager to try its powers to the uttermost.
A theme like this, wholly removed from
human interest, dealing with titanic and mythical
figures, is the most dangerous in the whole range
of possible subjects. Taylor rises so easily to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
high level of poetic achievement that it seems as
if he must presently touch some mountain peak.
Yet he always leaves the impression of really having
the strength to do that in which he fails. He
disappoints through the very display of power.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>His poetic work lacks idiosyncrasy, and to credit
him with having given rise to a ‘school’ is to be
generous rather than just. His talent fell just
short of his ambition. A busy life with its multitude
of cares and interests left him too little time
for brooding upon the great themes he affected,
and there was wanting the gift for relentless self-criticism
which operates almost like the creative
power. None the less his countrymen have not
begun to discharge the debt of gratitude they owe
him. Taylor had great virtues. It should be imputed
to him for literary righteousness that he was
willing to undertake the long poem. He never,
so far as is known, made the excuse our poets continually
offer, and which is almost infantile, that
the general public does not care for long poems,—as
if a poet were under any obligation to the
general public.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Henry Curtis</span>, who sailed for New England
from the port of London on May 6,
1635, was the founder of the Curtis family in
America. His grandson, John Curtis of Worcester,
was ‘a sturdy and open loyalist’ of Revolutionary
times whose personal character was as
heartily esteemed as his political principles were
detested.</p>

<p>George Curtis, a great-grandson of John, married
Mary Elizabeth Burrill, daughter of James
Burrill, Jr., Chief-justice of Rhode Island. Of
their two sons George William Curtis was the
younger. He was born in Providence, Rhode
Island, on February 24, 1824.</p>

<p>With his brother James Burrill, his closest
friend and almost inseparable companion, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
sent to C. W. Greene’s school at Jamaica Plain,
near Boston, and remained there five years. He
was afterwards at school in Providence for four
years. In New York, whither his father had removed
(in 1839) to become connected with the
Bank of Commerce, Curtis studied under private
tutors and had some experience of practical life in
the counting-room of a German importing house.</p>

<p>The education given the Curtis boys had also
an irregular though very agreeable side. They
spent much of the time from 1842 to 1844 as
students at Brook Farm. The greater part of the
two following years they were at Concord, their
object being to combine study and out-of-door
life, and above all to be near Emerson. Taking
up residence with one or other of several farmers
whose local fame almost equalled that of the Concord
men of letters, they spent half of each day in
farm work and the other half in study or studious
idleness. They were to be found regularly at the
Club which met on Monday evenings in Emerson’s
library and which numbered among its members
Hawthorne, Thoreau, and Alcott.</p>

<p>In August, 1846, provided by his father with a
sum of money sufficient to give him what he
called ‘a generous background,’ Curtis went
abroad. He planned to be gone two years, but
the background was more than generous and he
did not return until 1850. He travelled leisurely
through France, Germany, Italy, and the East,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
made notes of what he saw and used them partly
in the form of letters to the New York ‘Courier
and Enquirer’ and partly in the famous ‘Howadji’
books. His literary plans were ambitious,
including as they did a life of Mehemet Ali, on
which he worked for some years only to abandon
it at last.</p>

<p>On his return to New York he began writing
regularly for the ‘Tribune,’ and was associated
with C. F. Briggs and Parke Godwin in the editorship
of ‘Putnam’s Magazine.’ When the magazine
passed into the hands of Dix, Edwards, and Company,
Curtis put money into the firm. By their
failure he not only lost everything he had, but he
also assumed a debt for which he could not have
been legally held and devoted the proceeds of his
lectures to paying it. He was eighteen years in
ridding himself of the burden.</p>

<p>In 1854 he began printing the famous ‘Easy
Chair’ papers in ‘Harper’s Monthly,’ and in
1857 the department of ‘Harper’s Weekly’ called
‘The Lounger.’ The latter was a frank imitation
in part of the <i>Tatler</i> and <i>Spectator</i>, even to the
letters from lady correspondents such as Nelly
Lancer, Sabina Griddle, and Xantippe. During
the ten years following his return from abroad
Curtis published six books: <i>Nile Notes of a Howadji</i>,
1851; <i>The Howadji in Syria</i>, 1852; <i>Lotus-Eating</i>,
1852; <i>The Potiphar Papers</i>, 1853; <i>Prue
and I</i>, 1857; <i>Trumps</i>, 1861. His ambitions had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
hitherto been chiefly literary. To be sure, in 1856,
at Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut,
he had given his address on ‘The Duty of
the American Scholar to Politics and the Times,’
and had followed it with his oration on ‘Patriotism’
and his lecture on ‘The Present Aspect of
the Slavery Question.’<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> He had taken the stump
for Frémont in 1856, and been a delegate to the
Republican National Convention in 1860, where
his courage, adroitness, and impassioned eloquence
had saved the platform at a moment when it
needed salvation. Nevertheless it may be said
that the first ten years of Curtis’s life as a writer
and speaker were ‘literary’ with a strong emphasis
on politics, and that the last thirty years
were political with an undiminished interest in
letters.</p>

<p>On Thanksgiving Day, 1856, Curtis married
Anna Shaw, a daughter of F. G. Shaw, formerly
of West Roxbury, and a sister of Colonel Robert
Gould Shaw. He had made her acquaintance at
Brook Farm twelve years earlier. There is a pretty
reference to her in one of his letters to Dwight
written in 1844. Curtis had been in Boston for the
day: ‘Anna Shaw and Rose Russell passed me
like beautiful spirits; one like a fresh morning,
the other like an oriental night.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span></p>

<p>In 1863 Curtis became the political editor of
‘Harper’s Weekly’ with the proviso that he was
to have a free hand. He represented political
ideals than which there can be no higher; his discussions
were marked by absolute frankness, joined
to perfect courtesy. The parts which fell to him
in the drama of political life were always important
and often conspicuous. He was a delegate both to
National and to State conventions, and a delegate-at-large
to the convention for revising the State
constitution of New York. Although ‘nominated
by acclamation’ for Secretary of the State
of New York (1869), he refused to serve. He did
allow his name to be presented for governor in the
convention of 1870, supposing all to be in good
faith; but when he discovered that he was the
victim of a trick,—the object being to defeat
Greeley,—he withdrew.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>Next to Anti-slavery his favorite cause was that
of Civil Service reform. In 1865 he became
‘second in command’ to Thomas A. Jenckes of
Rhode Island, the pioneer in the movement. He
was the head of the Civil Service Commission appointed
by President Grant in 1871. As president
of the New York Civil Service Reform Association
and of the National Civil Service Reform
League, he did a work of immediate and lasting
value.</p>

<p>In 1877 President Hayes offered Curtis his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
choice of the foreign missions, supposing that he
would elect to go to England. In refusing the
honor Curtis expressed the doubt whether ‘a man
absolutely without legal training of any kind
could be a proper minister.’ Later the German
mission was urged on him, but he saw no reason
to change his former opinion. As an Independent,
Curtis voiced opposition to machine methods in
the State campaign of 1879, and in 1884 broke
with his party and gave his support to Cleveland.</p>

<p>Albeit he was not college bred, Curtis received
a full share of the honorary degrees which American
colleges lavish every June upon those who
have acquired reputation. For the two years prior
to his death he was Chancellor of the University
of New York.</p>

<p>The literary work of his middle and later years
remains for the most part embedded in the files
of ‘Harper’s Monthly.’ Three or four little
volumes of ‘Easy Chair’ papers (less than a tenth
part of the whole number of his contributions)
were printed in 1893–94. Written to serve an
ephemeral purpose, these essays have a permanent
value. It is singular that there is no demand
for more reprints of the work of a writer whose
journalism was better than most men’s books.
Besides the ‘Easy Chair’ papers there were published
posthumously <i>Orations and Addresses edited
by C. E. Norton</i>, 1894; <i>Literary and Social Essays</i>,
1895; <i>Ars Recte Vivendi</i>, 1898; <i>Early Letters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
George William Curtis to John S. Dwight, edited by
G. W. Cooke</i>, 1898.</p>

<p>Curtis died, after a long and painful illness, on
August 31, 1892.</p>

<h3 id="sec_86">II<br />

<span class="subhead">THE MAN</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Of</span> Curtis it may be said that his character is revealed
in every line of his writing and in every act of his
public and private life. He was gracious, winning,
generous, quick to forgive, and slow to take offence.
Goodness as exemplified in not a few good men is
alike painful to those who possess it and to those
on whom its influence is exerted. Virtue as exemplified
in him never wore the austere garb or the
gloomy countenance.</p>

<p>At the time of Curtis’s defection from the Republican
party incredible abuse was showered on
him, not only in the press but through anonymous
letters. He was much saddened by it, less from
the personal point of view than because of the
revelation it gave of the meanness and vindictiveness
of human nature. Having thought too well
of his fellows, he suffered under the disillusionment,
all of which goes to show how optimistic at heart
this disciple of Thackeray and writer of satires was.
And when Senator Conkling made a savage personal
attack on him in the New York State convention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
of 1877, Curtis seems to have had no feeling
towards his enemy but that of pity: ‘It was
the saddest sight I ever knew, that man glaring
at me in a fury of hate and storming out his foolish
blackguardism.’</p>

<p>If Curtis’s career illustrates one thing above another,
it is his willingness to sacrifice mental ease
and personal comfort for an ideal. But the sacrifice
was made with such good nature, such grace
in the acquiescence, that one forgets its extent, and
even makes the mistake of thinking that possibly
it cost him little. Undoubtedly it cost him much,
this giving up of literature for politics, this putting
aside of all public honors because there was a
nearer duty which could not be neglected.</p>

<h3 id="sec_87">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WRITER AND THE ORATOR</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> author of <i>Nile Notes of a Howadji</i> loved
alliteration. In his early books he amused himself
with pleasant arrangements of words such as
‘camels with calm, contemptuous eyes,’ or ‘lustrous
leaves languidly moving,’ or ‘slim minarets spiring
silverly and strangely from the undefined mass
of mud houses.’ Note this description of the
date-palm: ‘Plumed as a prince and graceful as a
gentleman, stands the date; and whoever travels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
among palms travels in good society;’ or this of
the sakias: ‘Like huge summer insects they doze
upon the bank, droning a melancholy, monotonous
song. The slow, sad sound pervades the
land—one calls to another, and he sighs to his
neighbor, and the Nile is shored with sound no
less than sand.’</p>

<p>Alliteration is a mark of youth. Employed to
excess it has a cloying effect, like that of diminished
sevenths in music. Of minor rhetorical arts
it is the poorest, the most seductive, the most
readily abused. But we should miss it sadly from
the ‘Howadji’ books. Removed from the context
these phrases quoted have an artificial sound, in
their place they blend perfectly.</p>

<p>Curtis’s style grew less florid and sensuous after
the early writings. At all times it is singularly easy.
One gets the impression that he was a spontaneous
writer. Great productivity is not possible when
there must be a constant retouching of phrases and
paragraphs. The unlabored nature of his writing
may explain the light estimate Curtis put on it.
He is said to have been quite unwilling to reprint
a volume of essays from the ‘Easy Chair.’ That
anything which came with so little effort could be
worth re-reading seemed not to occur to him.</p>

<p>He was the orator almost as soon as he was the
man of letters. A rhetorician by taste and training,
he knew the dangers of rhetoric and in his oratory
avoided them. Clarity and grace are the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
obvious characteristics of every sentence. Curtis
could no more have been awkward and heavy than
he could have been obscure.</p>

<p>He can hardly be praised enough for the ease
and naturalness of his allusions. We auditors
grow restless when a speaker begins to cite classical
names. We fear our old friends Cicero and
Catiline, Cæsar and Brutus. We cannot away with
Hannibal and Hamilcar. The ear has been dulled
by constant repetition. Curtis knew how to make
the oldest of these tiresome references seem new.
All his allusions have an air of freshness and spontaneity.
One would suppose the declaimers had
long since exhausted the virtues of Spartacus.
Curtis dared to make the old gladiator accessory
to his argument in a passage like <span class="locked">this:—</span></p>

<p>‘Spartacus was a barbarian, a pagan, and a slave.
Escaping he summoned other men whose liberty
was denied. His call rang clear through Italy
like an autumn storm through the forest, and
men answered him like clustering leaves.... He
had no rights that Romans were bound to respect,
but he wrote out in blood upon the plains of Lombardy
his equal humanity with Cato and Cæsar.
The tale is terrible. History shudders with it
still. But you and I, Plato and Shakespeare, the
mightiest and the meanest men, were honored in
Spartacus, for his wild revenge showed the brave
scorn of oppression that beats immortal in the
proud heart of man.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span></p>

<p>Nature had bestowed on Curtis gifts which, if
not indispensable to a speaker, are like free-will
offerings as against tribute, and make the pathway
smooth. His commanding presence, his winning
smile and manner, his glorious voice, the air of
high breeding, a self-possession which when accompanied
by unaffected good nature is one of
the most attractive traits—all combined to place
him among the first of American orators. He was
properly said (in a phrase which through vain repetition
has almost lost its meaning) to ‘grace’ the
platform.</p>

<h3 id="sec_88">IV<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>NILE NOTES OF A HOWADJI</i>, <i>PRUE AND I</i>,
<i>TRUMPS</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">‘In</span> Shakespeare’s day the nuisance was the Monsieur
Travellers who had swum in a gundello,’
wrote Fitzgerald in a half-petulant, half-humorous
mood, ‘but now the bores are those who have
smoked <i>tchibouques</i> with a <i>Peshaw</i>!’ He was
speaking of <i>Eothen</i>. The fever for Eastern books
was at its height when Curtis went abroad in 1846.</p>

<p>The <i>Nile Notes of a Howadji</i> describes the four
weeks’ flight of the ‘Ibis’ up the river to Aboo
Simbel, and the ‘course of temples’ on the return
voyage. It is a book of impressions and rhapsodies,
a glowing record of travel in which realism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
struggles with poetry and is usually worsted. It
is a dream of the Orient, delightfully parsimonious
as to improving facts, and prodigal of whatever
helps the home-keeping reader to comprehend
the witchery and fascination of the East. A few
timid souls were disturbed by ‘Fair Frailty’ and
‘Kushuk Arnem,’ which seem innocent enough
now, but the timid souls no doubt found peace in
other chapters, such as ‘Under the Palms.’</p>

<p><i>The Howadji in Syria</i> continues the record. The
conditions are changed. Instead of the dahabieh,
the camel; for the Ibis was substituted MacWhirter,
whose exertions in trotting ‘shook my soul
within me;’ for the mud villages and mysterious
temples of the Nile, Jerusalem, Acre, Damascus.
The temper of the book differs from that of its
predecessor. In this volume Curtis is poetical, in
the other he was a poet. The mocking American
note is heard, as when the Howadji says ‘a storm
besieged us in Nablous and a fellow Christian of
the Armenian persuasion secured us for his fleas,
during the time we remained.’ The Howadji has
evidently undergone a measure of disenchantment.
The wonders of the East are less wonderful because
less vague. In Egypt there was intoxication,
in Palestine and Syria there is curiosity, mingled
with amusement and contempt. The characteristic
quality of the second Howadji book is to be
found in the descriptions of the cafés, the bazaars,
and in that most excellent account of the Turkish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
bath (‘Uncle Kühleborn’), quite the best thing of
the kind that has been written.</p>

<p><i>Lotus-Eating</i> is a series of journalistic letters
on the Hudson, Trenton Falls, Niagara, Saratoga,
Newport, and Nahant, when Nahant was ‘a shower
of little brown cottages fallen upon the rocky
promontory that terminates Lynn beach.’ Not
in this wise do young men now write for newspapers,
with ornate periods and quotations from
Waller and Herrick. The book abounds in happy
characterizations. At Saratoga ‘we discriminate the
arctic and antarctic Bostonians, fair, still, stately,
with a vein of scorn in their Saratoga enjoyment,
and the languid, cordial, and careless Southerners,
far from precise in dress or style, but balmy in
manner as a bland Southern morning. We mark
the crisp courtesy of the New Yorker, elegant in
dress, exclusive in association, a pallid ghost of
Paris—without its easy elegance, its <i>bonhomie</i>,
its gracious <i>savoir faire</i>, without the <i>spirituel</i> sparkle
of its conversation, and its natural and elastic
grace of style.’ And so it runs on.</p>

<p><i>The Potiphar Papers</i> is in another key. The
placid observer, who, in <i>Lotus-Eating</i>, quoted from
De Quincey a delectable passage on the poetry
of dancing, is now a bitter satirist contemplating
a corps-de-ballet of society buds gyrating in the
arms of the <i>jeunesse dorée</i>. These ‘bounding belles’
and their admirers shock the observer with a style
of dancing which in its whirl, its ‘rush, its fury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
is only equalled by that of the masked balls at
the French opera.’ The book is a new treatment
(new in 1853) of the old subject of Vanity Fair.
The humor is severe. The touch is not light and
the caustic writing is not happy. Curtis was never
a master of the whip of scorpions. Nevertheless
<i>The Potiphar Papers</i> had a vogue.</p>

<p><i>Prue and I</i> is a book of the sort Zola used
to hate—literature which ‘consoles with the lies
of the imagination.’ It is the idyl of contented
obscurity, the poetic side of humble life. Delicately
wrought, light in texture, shot with charming
fancies and dainty conceits, having the grace
that belongs to old-school manners, this little prose
poem is justly accounted its author’s masterpiece.</p>

<p>Curtis wrote one novel, <i>Trumps</i>, and was disappointed
in the result. The book is readable,
but not because it is a story. Many good novelists
are made, not born. <i>Trumps</i> is the work of a
novelist in the making.</p>

<h3 id="sec_89">V<br />

<span class="subhead">THE EASY CHAIR</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">The</span> twenty-seven essays of the volume entitled
<i>From the Easy Chair</i> show very well in brief
compass the range of their author’s powers in
this form. Here are reminiscences of Browning
and his wife, of the Dickens readings in ’67, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
Everett’s oratory and Jennie Lind’s singing, of
a lecture by Emerson and a recital by Gottschalk
or by Thalberg, of a night at the play-house
with Jefferson, or a dinner at the old (the <i>very
old</i>) Delmonico’s, when that famous eating-house
stood at the corner of Broadway and Chambers
Street. The flavor of by-gone days is here. ‘It
was a pleasant little New York,’ says the essayist
regretfully, being mindful of the charm which
a lively small city possesses, and which a big city,
be it never so lively, somehow lacks.</p>

<p>Half the attractiveness of the ‘Easy Chair’ papers
is due to their seemingly unpremeditated character.
Curtis was not writing a book, nor was he
proposing at some time, ‘in response to the earnest
solicitations of friends upon whose judgment I
rely,’ to collect and republish these fugitive leaves.
He comes home after a little chat, perhaps, with
John Gilbert and sits down to tell us about it. Two
or three reflections suggested by the interview are
thrown in quite happily, and while we listeners
are most absorbed and in no mood to have him
break off, Curtis rises, and with some pleasant little
remark, nods, and smiles, and is gone. And one
of the listeners says, ‘I wish we saw him oftener.
He comes only once a month.’</p>

<p>The ‘Easy Chair’ papers are urban as well as
urbane. Curtis was a city man. We know that
he had a summer home in ‘Arcadia’ and was
happy there, but his joy in city life is betrayed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
almost every paper he wrote. No passionate lover
of nature, intent on fringed gentians and purling
brooks, penned that description of a gown—‘a
mass of pleats and puffs and marvelous trimmings,
which, when profusely extravagant upon
the form of an elderly woman, always reminds me
of signals of distress hung out upon a craft that
is drifting far away from the enchanted isles of
youth.’</p>

<p>Satirist though he is, Curtis in the ‘Easy Chair’
is always the gentle satirist. He writes of the
mannerless sex, of the people who rent boxes at
the opera because they can talk better there than
at home, of the taste of the town so greedy for
minute details of the doings of the rich and the
fashionable, but there is no acerbity in his tone.
Here is an illustration of his manner. The Cosmopolitan
of the ‘Easy Chair’ talks with Mrs.
Grundy, who proposes as a great boon to introduce
him to a very rich man. ‘“You say he is very
rich?” “Enormously, fabulously,” replied Mrs.
Grundy, as if crossing herself.’</p>

<p>‘Trifles light as air’ would be a not inadequate
description of hundreds of the ‘Easy Chair’ papers.
And they are quite as wholesome as air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_90">VI<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>ORATIONS AND ADDRESSES</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Curtis’s</span> biographer holds that the volume of reports
and addresses on Civil Service reform is
‘in some respects the most valuable of all [his]
writings.’<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> The entire collection of <i>Orations and
Addresses</i>, comprising over a thousand pages, is no
less a manual of literary than of civic virtues. A
student of the art of expression can well afford to
make this book his vade mecum. Here is a body
of practical illustration of how to write and how
to speak. The oration on ‘The Duty of the
American Scholar to Politics and the Times,’ delivered
when Curtis was thirty-two years of age,
is an extraordinary performance. Few addresses
hold one in the reading like this. What it must
have been in the delivery we can but faintly imagine.
It is another splendid proof that literature
and oratory may occupy a common ground, neither
usurping the other’s place. With the amplest use
of oratorical arts the speaker makes rhetoric subordinate
to thought. It shows fully (does this
oration) one marked virtue of Curtis’s public discourse,
its perfect urbanity. His speeches were
free from invective, from personalities of any sort,
from every feature born of mere impulse of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
moment. If he was ever tempted to give vigor and
point to his phrase by means which must afterward
be regretted, temptation never got the better of him.</p>

<p>The leading thesis of the Wesleyan College
oration—that the scholar is not the recluse, the
pale valetudinarian, a woman without woman’s
charm, but a man—may not have been new; but
the putting was fresh, vivid, inspiring, eloquent.
The oration may be compared with Emerson’s
utterances on the same theme. Emerson’s treatment
is the more philosophical; that of Curtis is
the better adapted to public speech.</p>

<p>Along with this oration should be read the address
on ‘Patriotism,’ in which Curtis defends the
doctrine that where law violates the primary conception
of human rights it is our duty to disobey
the law, and the address entitled ‘The Present
Aspect of the Slavery Question,’ in which Curtis
said, ‘Government is, unquestionably, a science of
compromises, but only of policies and interests,
not of essential rights; and if of them, then the
sacrifice must fall on all.’</p>

<p>These three are but the beginning of a series of
orations from among which the great eulogies of
Sumner and of Wendell Phillips, of Bryant and
of Lowell, may be chosen as the very crown of his
work.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The critic (and there are such critics) who values
almost lightly the sentimental and poetic literary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
work of Curtis’s young manhood is perhaps not
entirely unjust; Curtis would have agreed with
him. But the critic would be unjust if he overlooked
the value of this literary training in giving
an enormous increase of power. We shall never
know how much the editorial writer and political
orator gained in clarity, precision, beauty of style,
effectiveness, by the penning of a series of books
in which for pages together he revels in the mere
music of words. The author of the address on
Sumner was largely indebted to the author of the
<i>Nile Notes of a Howadji</i> and <i>Prue and I</i>.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Donald Grant Mitchell</span>, who won literary
reputation under the name of ‘Ik Marvel,’
was born at Norwich, Connecticut, on April
12, 1822. He is a son of the Reverend Alfred
Mitchell, formerly pastor of the Second Congregational
Church of Norwich, and a grandson of
Stephen Mix Mitchell, an eminent jurist and
member of the Continental Congress. He prepared
for college at John Hall’s school at Ellington,
and was graduated at Yale in 1841.</p>

<p>Three years of life on a farm for his health gave
him a bent towards rural pleasures and occupations.
In 1844, still in pursuit of health, he visited England,
the Isle of Jersey, France, and Holland. His
first book, <i>Fresh Gleanings, or a New Sheaf from the
Old Fields of Continental Europe</i> (1847), was the
literary fruit of this journey.</p>

<p>Mitchell took up the study of law in New
York, but found himself physically unequal to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
sedentary life. Moreover, France was on the eve
of revolution. The young law student thought
it no time to dawdle over Puffendorf, Grotius, and
‘the amiable, aristocratic Blackstone,’ when there
was a chance to see history made. He ‘threw
Puffendorf, big as he was, into the corner,’ and
started for Paris, spent eight months there, saw
what he went to see, and described it in his second
book, <i>Battle Summer</i> (1850).<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>His third literary venture was a periodical essay,
<i>The Lorgnette, or Studies of the Town, by an Opera-Goer</i>.
It was published weekly for six months,
and sold by Henry Kernot, ‘a small bookseller
up Broadway, at the centre of what was then
the fashionable shopping region.’ For a time
the secret of the authorship was well kept, Kernot
being as much in the dark as the public. To
divert suspicion from himself, Mitchell thought
to bring out in a distant city, and under his own
name, something ‘of an entirely different quality
and tone’ from <i>The Lorgnette</i>. He failed in getting
a Boston publisher, and <i>Reveries of a Bachelor</i>,
the book in question, was published by Baker
and Scribner in New York (1850). Its success
led to the making of another series of ‘reveries.’
This was <i>Dream Life</i>, written in six weeks of the
summer and published in the fall of 1851. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
these two books ‘Ik Marvel’s’ reputation with
the general reading public still rests.</p>

<p>In May, 1853, Mitchell was appointed United
States consul at Venice. On the thirty-first of the
same month he married Miss Mary F. Pringle,
of Charleston, South Carolina, and in June sailed
for Italy. The account of his induction into the
consular office will be found in <i>Seven Stories</i>. A
lively and good-humored narrative, it is not to be
read without great amusement, together with a
feeling of contempt for the shabby way in which
our glorious (and sometimes parsimonious) republic
used to treat its humbler officials. During
the two years of his consulship Mitchell collected
materials for a history of the Venetian Republic.
The book is still unpublished, and presumably
has been long since abandoned.</p>

<p>The days of his public service being at an end,
Mitchell returned to America and settled on an
estate near New Haven (‘Edgewood’), where since
1855 he has led the life of a man of letters and gentleman
farmer. In addition to the books already
named, he has published: <i>Fudge Doings</i>, 1855; <i>My
Farm of Edgewood</i>, 1863; <i>Seven Stories</i>, 1864;
<i>Wet Days at Edgewood</i>, 1865; <i>Doctor Johns</i>, 1866;
<i>Rural Studies</i>, 1867;<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> <i>About Old Story Tellers</i>,
1877; <i>The Woodbridge Record</i>, 1883; <i>Bound Together</i>,
1884; <i>English Lands, Letters, and Kings</i>, 1889–90;
<i>American Lands and Letters</i>, 1897.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span></p>

<p>For a time Mitchell was editor of the ‘Atlantic
Almanac’ (1868–69), and for one year (1869)
editor of ‘Hearth and Home.’ He served as one
of the judges of industrial art at the Centennial
Exhibition (1876), and was a United States commissioner
at the Paris Exposition of 1878. He
has lectured much on literature and art. Yale recognized
his achievements in letters by conferring
on him, in 1878, the degree of LL. D.</p>

<p>He is one of the most attractive figures of our
time, not alone because of his unaffected goodness,
his charm of manner, his literary reputation,
but because he is the last survivor of a group of
writers who in the Fifties made New York famous,
and about whose association there still clings a
very attractive atmosphere of romance.</p>

<h3 id="sec_92">II<br />

<span class="subhead">THE AUTHOR AND THE MAN</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">A critic</span> who was given a copy of <i>Dream Life</i>
and asked to draw the character of the author
therefrom, might possibly come to conclusions like
these. ‘Ik Marvel,’ he would say, must be very
generous, sympathetic with respect to the lesser
weaknesses of human nature, and charitable towards
the greater, or else this book is a falsehood from
beginning to end. He must be very manly, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
in all its two hundred pages there is not a cynical
note or a sneer. He must be humorous, or he
could not have written the chapters on ‘A New
England Squire’ and ‘The Country Church,’ to
say nothing of the account of the loves of Clarence
and Jenny. He must be sentimental, or the
chapter entitled ‘A Good Wife’ had been an impossibility.</p>

<p>At every point the book betrays its Puritan
origin. ‘Ik Marvel’ is a moralist. He makes a
direct and constant appeal to the ethical sentiment.
In one of his prefaces he mentions the fact—doubtless
an amused smile played about his lips
as he wrote the lines—that <i>Dream Life</i> has sometimes
insinuated itself into Sunday-school libraries.
He hopes it has ‘worked no blight there.’
At all events, ‘there are six days in the week ...
on which its perusal could do no mischief.’
Doubtless the moral lessons are commonplace
enough, but their triteness is relieved by the literary
quality. Puritanism without its narrowness,
and sentimentalism controlled by humor and good
sense, lie at the basis of <i>Reveries of a Bachelor</i> and
<i>Dream Life</i>. The character of their author is to be
plainly if not completely read in these two books.</p>

<p>The distinctive flavor of ‘Ik Marvel’s’ literary
style may be got in the pleasing volume entitled
<i>Fresh Gleanings</i>. Limpidity, grace, ease, are
among the virtues of his prose. The fabric of
words is light, airy, richly colored at times, but not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
over colored. With due recognition of his individuality
it may be said that ‘Ik Marvel’ was
a literary son of ‘Geoffrey Crayon.’ The sweetness,
the leisurely flow of the narrative, the unobtrusiveness
of manner, all suggest Irving. Perhaps
Mitchell meant to acknowledge his literary paternity
when he dedicated <i>Dream Life</i> to the author
of <i>The Sketch Book</i>. But while we recognize this
debt to Irving it is most important that we do not
exaggerate it.</p>

<p>One marked exception must be made. There
is no hint of Irving in <i>Battle Summer</i>, an account
of the Revolution of 1848, every page of which
echoes more or less distinctly the voice of Carlyle.
So close is the imitation at times as to awaken a
doubt whether <i>Battle Summer</i> was not intended
for a ‘serious parody.’ At all events, it is one of
many proofs of the strong hold the <i>History of
the French Revolution</i> had on the minds of young
men.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE WRITINGS</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><i>Fresh Gleanings</i> is a volume of travel, written in a
way to persuade one of the uselessness of pictorial
illustrations. Its manner occasionally suggests
Sterne’s <i>Sentimental Journey</i>, which the young traveller
may have been reading of late. Sentiment and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
humor are agreeably blended. Under ‘Ik Marvel’s’
guidance one visits Paris, Limoges, Arles,
Nîmes, Montpellier, Rouen, carefully avoiding the
‘objects of interest’ and learning much about the
life. A less courageous writer would have told us
more and shown us less.</p>

<p>Books like this always contain interpolated stories,
told around the inn fire, or over the half-cup
at the café. The ‘Story of Le Merle,’ ‘An Old
Chronicle of the City,’ ‘Hinzelmann,’ and ‘Boldo’s
Story’ are graceful, but so brief as to seem mere
anecdotes.</p>

<p><i>The Lorgnette</i>, consisting of the lucubrations of
one ‘John Timon,’ is an amusing and instructive
periodical. Not its least entertaining feature is the
account of the literary distempers of the day, the
Tupper fever, the Festus outbreak, the Jane Eyre
malady, and the Typee disorder, together with
other literary epidemics. Neither <i>The Lorgnette</i>
nor <i>Fudge Doings</i> is now much read. But if the
modern cynic, who takes, possibly, a condescending
attitude towards these old satires on fashionable
life, will but pick up a copy of <i>Fudge Doings</i>
and try a few chapters, he will be forced to admit
that if we should not to-day think of writing satire
in this manner, it may have been a good way in
1855. Perchance in opening the volume at random
he comes on the account of the adventure of
Wash. Fudge with the black domino. In which
case he will find himself betrayed into reading two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
chapters at least, for he must needs take the trouble
to learn how the affair ended.</p>

<p><i>Fudge Doings</i> and <i>The Lorgnette</i> may be looked
on as a contribution to the history of manners.
By their aid one reconstructs the drama of fashionable
life in the mid-century, sees what was then
thought monstrous, and incidentally learns how
simple the vices of the grandfathers were.</p>

<p><i>Reveries of a Bachelor</i> ushers one into a quaint
and delightful world. The reveries are of love—whether,
in the words of Robert Burton quoting
Plotinus, ‘it be a God, or a divell, or passion of the
minde.’ The book is by no means compounded
exclusively of moonshine and roses. Some of the
pictures are calculated to give a bachelor pause.
Here is Peggy who loves you, or at least swears it,
with her hand on the <i>Sorrows of Werther</i>. She is
not bad looking, Peggy, ‘save a bit too much of
forehead.’ But she is ‘such a sad blue’ who will
spend her money on the ‘Literary World’ and
the <i>Friends in Council</i>.</p>

<p>By the severer standards of our day Peggy was
not so much of a ‘blue.’ None the less she is distinctly
literary. She reads Dante and ‘funny Goldoni’
and leaves spots of baby-gruel on a Tasso
of 1680. She adores La Bruyère; even reads him
while nurse gets dinner and ‘you are holding the
baby.’</p>

<p>The vision presently becomes terrific and can
only be dispelled by a vicious kick at the forestick.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
Revery, misnamed idleness, has its uses. Whatever
else comes true, the Bachelor will not marry
a young woman who consoles her husband for an
ill-cooked dinner by quotations from the Greek
Anthology.</p>

<p><i>Dream Life</i> is also a collection of ‘reveries.’
Under the similitude of the seasons, the author
has pencilled little sketches of boyhood, youth,
manhood, and age. The temptation to the obvious
in morals and sentiment must have been great;
but again Mitchell’s literary skill and his humor
carry him through successfully.</p>

<p><i>Seven Stories with Basement and Attic</i> is a group
of narratives drawn from the author’s ‘plethoric
little note books of travel.’ The ‘Basement’ is
the introduction, the ‘Attic’ the conclusion.
The first story, ‘Wet Day at an Irish Inn,’ shows
how, if he be observant, a man may have adventures
without taking the trouble to cross the street
in search of them. Three of the stories are French
(‘Le Petit Soulier,’ ‘The Cabriolet,’ and ‘Emile
Roque’); another is Swiss (the ‘Bride of the Ice
King’); yet another is Italian (‘Count Pesaro’),
and all are exquisite, written in a style which for
sweetness and unaffected ease is, if not a lost art,
at all events a neglected one. It has been said
that our young men would not care to write in
this fashion to-day; it is a question whether our
young men would be able to do so.</p>

<p>One novel stands to ‘Ik Marvel’s’ credit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
<i>Doctor Johns</i>, a story of a New England country
parsonage, well written because its author could
not write otherwise, faithful and exact because he
knew the life, yet going no deeper than other attempts
to explain the New England character, the
externals of which are so easy to portray and the
real essence so baffling.</p>

<p>Among the best of ‘Ik Marvel’s’ books are
those dealing with rural life. <i>My Farm of Edgewood</i>
sets forth the author’s adventures in buying
a country home, and his subsequent adventures in
settling therein and making life variously profitable.
It is a successful attempt to magnify the office of
gentleman-farmer. The attractiveness of the life
is not over-emphasized, nor is it pretended that
that is legitimate farming which produces big crops
regardless of expense.</p>

<p>The picture as a whole is seductive in ways not
to be referred to the literary skill of the artist. It
is odd enough how a lay-reader, unused to carrots
and cabbages, will follow every detail of
Mitchell’s experiment. Here must be some outcroppings
of the primitive instinct. Moreover, the
book relates to home-making, a subject perennially
dear to the American heart. Our restlessness has
never unsettled us in that regard.</p>

<p><i>Wet Days at Edgewood</i> is a companion volume.
The days here celebrated, nine in number, were
made bright by readings about ‘old farmers, old
gardeners, and old pastorals.’ Rejoicing in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
strong common sense of ancient writers on husbandry,
and in the quaint flavor of their style,
‘Ik Marvel’ chats of Roman farm and villa life,
recalling what Varro and Columella had to say
about the art of tilling the soil. He takes pleasure
in the reflection that ‘yon open furrow ... carries
trace of the ridging in the “Works and Days;”
that the brown field of half-broken clods is the
fallow (Νεός) of Xenophon,’ and that ‘Cato gives
orders for the asparagus.’</p>

<p>Then he comes to modern times, to the days
of Thomas Tusser, Sir Hugh Platt, Gervase
Markham, Samuel Hartlib, Jethro Tull, and
William Shenstone, men who farmed practically,
or theoretically, or even poetically. ‘Ik Marvel’
loves them all, even those whose enthusiasm was
in the ratio of their helplessness. No less dear to
him is Goldsmith, who wrote what passes for a
rural tale and is not rural at all, but comically
urban, and Charles Lamb, who hated the country
and gladly avowed it.</p>

<p>These are Mitchell’s principal works. Having
read thus far, it were a pity to overlook the two
volumes on <i>English Lands, Letters, and Kings</i>, and
a greater pity to overlook the instructive and entertaining
<i>American Lands and Letters</i>. In brief,
the reader who insists on knowing ‘Ik Marvel’
only by <i>Reveries of a Bachelor</i> does his author an
injustice and robs himself of many hours of literary
delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span></p>

<p>Sentimentalism will always manifest itself in
literature in one form or another. That there will
be a return to the manner which we associate with
‘Ik Marvel’ is not likely, yet it was sentimentalism
in its manliest form. The continued popularity
of <i>Reveries of a Bachelor</i> suggests that
Americans of to-day are not quite as cynical and
irreverent as they are sometimes painted, or as
they love to paint themselves.</p>

<span class="subhead">HIS LIFE</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Lowells of New England are descendants
of Percival Lowell, a prosperous Bristol merchant
who came to America in 1639 and settled
at Newbury, Massachusetts. The family has been
distinguished through its various representatives
for public spirit and business acumen as well as
for a devotion to letters. The grandfather of
the poet, Judge John Lowell, was author of the
clause in the Bill of Rights abolishing slavery in
Massachusetts. One of his sons was founder of
the great manufacturing city on the Merrimac
which bears his name. A grandson established the
Lowell Institute, a system of popular instruction
by free courses of lectures,—a system unique, in
that it aims to bring to its audiences representative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
scholars, chosen less for their skill in the
graceful but often specious art of public speaking
than for solid attainments.</p>

<p>James Russell Lowell, the youngest son of the
Reverend Charles Lowell, minister of the West
Church in Boston, was born at Cambridge, Massachusetts,
in the colonial mansion known as ‘Elmwood,’
on February 22, 1819. His mother, Harriet
(Spence) Lowell, was a daughter of Keith
Spence, of Portsmouth, New Hampshire.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>Under William Wells (an English pedagogue of
the old school) Lowell prepared for college, entered
Harvard, and after some disciplinary tribulations
was graduated with his class (1838). He studied
law and was admitted to the bar (August, 1840),
but remained briefless during the few months of
his efforts to begin a practice.</p>

<p>While waiting for clients, he busied himself with
literature. He was early a rhymer. At twelve years
of age his skill in making verse had astonished his
schoolfellows, one of whom rushed home in great
excitement to announce that ‘Jemmy Lowell
thought he was going to be a poet.’</p>

<p>With the fearlessness of youth and in the hope
of bettering himself financially, Lowell, aided by
his friend Robert Carter, started a magazine, ‘The
Pioneer.’ According to the prospectus, dated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
October 15, 1842, the editors proposed to supply
‘the intelligent and reflecting portion of the Reading
Public with a substitute for the enormous
quantity of thrice diluted trash, in the shape of
namby-pamby love tales and sketches, which is
monthly poured out to them....’ Only three
numbers of ‘The Pioneer’ were issued.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> The
‘Reading Public’ was joined to its idols and declined
to encourage ‘a healthy and manly Periodical Literature.’</p>

<p>In 1841 was published <i>A Year’s Life</i>, Lowell’s
first volume of verse; it was followed by <i>Poems</i>
(1844), by a volume of prose, <i>Conversations on Some
of the Old Poets</i> (1845), and by Poems, ‘second
series’ (1848).</p>

<p>The ‘Ianthe’ of <i>A Year’s Life</i> was easily identified
with Maria White, the gifted and beautiful
girl who, in December, 1844, became the poet’s
wife. The first year of their married life was passed
in Philadelphia, whither Lowell had taken his
bride to protect her from the harsh New England
winter. Their financial resources were few, but of
gayety and courage there was no lack. Lowell
aspired to live by his pen. What with the small
sums paid him (rather against his will) for editorial
work on ‘The Pennsylvania Freeman,’ what
with the hardly larger sums for contributions to
‘Graham’s Magazine’ and ‘The Broadway Journal,’
he managed to subsist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, it seemed best for a number of
reasons that the young people return to Cambridge
and make a common home at ‘Elmwood’
with Lowell’s parents. In June of this year (1846)
appeared ‘A Letter from Mr. Ezekiel Biglow
of Jaalam to the Hon. Joseph T. Buckingham,
editor of the Boston Courier, inclosing a poem of
his son, Mr. Hosea Biglow.’ This was the first
of <i>The Biglow Papers</i>, the initial attack of many
attacks Lowell was to make on slavery with the
weapons of satire and ridicule. During 1847 three
more ‘papers’ were printed in the ‘Courier;’ the
remaining five appeared in ‘The National Anti-Slavery
Standard.’</p>

<p>When the ‘Standard’ passed from the control
of a board of editors into the hands of Sydney
Howard Gay, Lowell became a salaried contributor,
and for a time his name appeared as corresponding
editor. He was allowed a free hand.
Abolitionist though he was, his abolitionism was
tempered with a deal of sympathy for slaveholders.
And he had interests which most reformers of the
time lacked, a passionate love of letters, for example.
Hence it was that in the midst of leader-writing
he was penning <i>A Fable for Critics</i> and
<i>The Vision of Sir Launfal</i>.</p>

<p>The winter of 1851–52 Lowell spent with his
family in Italy, and the following spring and summer
in journeyings through France, England, Scotland,
and Wales. In October he sailed for home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
having as ship companions Thackeray and Arthur
Hugh Clough. Just a year later Mrs. Lowell died
(October 27, 1853). For months afterward Lowell
was in ‘great agony of mind, and he had to force
himself into those laborious hours which one instinctively
feels contain a wise restorative.’<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>He abounded in literary plans, some of which
(and among them a novel) were never carried out,
whereas others, his papers in ‘Putnam’s Magazine’
and his lectures on English Poetry, before
the Lowell Institute, were in a high degree successful.
Each lecture of the Institute course had
to be given twice, so great was the demand for
tickets. Lowell was very nervous over his first
platform experience, and not a little pleased when
he found that he could hold the audience an hour
and a quarter (‘they are in the habit of going out
at the end of the hour’). The singular merit of
the lectures led to his being appointed to the chair
of belles-lettres at Harvard, just resigned by Longfellow.
After a year’s study abroad the new professor
entered on his academic duties (September,
1856).</p>

<p>In 1857 Lowell married Miss Frances Dunlap,
of Portland, Maine. She was a woman of reserved
though gracious manners and rare beauty, who
through her serene temper and fine critical sagacity,
together with a keen sense of the humorous, exerted
a most beneficent influence on Lowell’s life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span></p>

<p>The burdens of college work were not so heavy
as to prevent Lowell’s assuming the editorship of
‘The Atlantic Monthly,’ a new literary magazine
with an anti-slavery bias. He held this post from
1857 to 1861, and proved to be one of the best
of editors, though routine was irksome to him,
and the vagaries of contributors called for more
patience than he could at all times command. Two
years after leaving the ‘Atlantic’ he undertook to
edit the ‘North American Review’ in company
with Charles Eliot Norton, on whom fell the chief
responsibilities. Lowell, for his part, contributed
to the ‘Review’ many notable papers on politics
and literature.</p>

<p>The Civil War called out much of Lowell’s
most spirited prose and not a little of his best
poetry. A second series of <i>Biglow Papers</i> appeared
in the ‘Atlantic,’ and for the commemoration of
sons of Harvard who had fought for the Union,
Lowell wrote his magnificent <i>Commemoration Ode</i>.
This noble performance was literally an improvisation,
written in a single night.</p>

<p>At this point we may take note of Lowell’s
publications, subsequent to the <i>Poems</i>, ‘second
series.’ They are: <i>A Fable for Critics</i>, 1848;
<i>The Biglow Papers</i>, 1848; <i>Fireside Travels</i>, 1864;
<i>The Biglow Papers</i>, ‘second series,’ 1866; <i>Under
the Willows and Other Poems</i>, 1869; <i>The Cathedral</i>,
1870; <i>Among My Books</i>, 1870; <i>My Study
Windows</i>, 1871; <i>Among My Books</i>, ‘second series,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
1876; <i>Three Memorial Poems</i>, 1877; <i>Democracy
and Other Addresses</i>, 1887; <i>Political Addresses</i>,
1888; <i>Heartsease and Rue</i>, 1888.</p>

<p>There appeared posthumously <i>Latest Literary
Essays</i>, 1891; <i>The Old English Dramatists</i>, 1892;
<i>Letters of James Russell Lowell, edited by C. E.
Norton</i>, 1893; <i>Last Poems</i>, 1895; <i>The Anti-Slavery
Papers of James Russell Lowell</i>, 1902.</p>

<p>Lowell resigned his professorship in 1872 and
went abroad for two years. Oxford conferred on
him the degree of D. C. L. and Cambridge that of
LL. D.; it pleased him to regard the Cambridge
degree ‘as in a measure a friendly recognition
of the University’s daughter in the American
Cambridge.’ In 1874 he returned home, and on
the opening of college was persuaded to resume
his lectures.</p>

<p>During the presidential campaign of 1876 Lowell
became politically active in ways new to him.
He was a delegate to the Republican National
convention and a presidential elector. His fellow-townsmen
had wished him to accept a nomination
for representative in Congress; but Lowell
refused, believing himself unqualified for the post.</p>

<p>Not long after his inauguration President Hayes,
at the instance of W. D. Howells, offered Lowell
the Austrian mission, an honor the poet felt impelled
to decline; when, however, it was learned
that he would be very willing to go to Spain, the
appointment was made. He arrived in Madrid on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
August 14, 1878. Two years later he was transferred
to England. Reappointed by President
Garfield, he held this important charge until the
close of President Arthur’s administration.</p>

<p>Few ministers have been as popular as he. And
not the least factor of his popularity in England
was his sturdy patriotism. Lowell was the author
of the essay ‘On a Certain Condescension in
Foreigners,’ an essay which an ingratiating Anglican
clergyman<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> says was meant to be ‘overheard’
in England. It were more exact to say that the
essay was meant to be heard, and heard distinctly.
‘They honor stoutness in each other,’ said Emerson,
noting the traits of the English people. And
it is not unreasonable to believe that they also
admire the same virtue in others.</p>

<p>The summer of 1885 Lowell passed at Southborough,
forty miles from Boston, the home of his
daughter, Mrs. Burnett. He made a number of
public addresses, gave a Lowell Institute course
of lectures on the ‘Old English Dramatists,’ argued
the question of International Copyright before a
committee of the Senate, and is believed to have
had real influence in persuading representatives
of this great country that stealing is a sin. He
found himself inveigled into an author’s reading,
and humorously bewailed his weakness in ever
having written a line of poetry. The demands
upon him were enormous. It was now an effort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
for him to do things, and if the grasshopper had
not yet become a burden, public occasions had,
and more than once he was obliged to beg off
from keeping a promise inconsiderately made.</p>

<p>He enjoyed being in England for the summer,
and usually divided his time between London and
Whitby. The last of these visits took place in
1889. The ensuing winter he gave to a careful
revision of his writings. In the spring of 1890
he was ill for six weeks, and though he recovered
enough to be able to move about a little and to
welcome his friends, serious work was out of the
question. He wrote two or three short papers,
and had strong inducements held out to him to
write more, but the time for writing was past, and
he knew it.</p>

<p>His sufferings during his last illness were great,
but he bore them like the man he was. Lowell
died at ‘Elmwood,’ Cambridge, on August 12,
1891.</p>

<h3 id="sec_95">II<br />

<span class="subhead">LOWELL’S CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">‘I am</span> a kind of twins myself, divided between
grave and gay,’ said Lowell, in one of those rare
moments when he condescended to self-analysis.
The duality of temperament here pointed at is one
secret of the fascination he exerted on all who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
privileged to know him intimately. The fascination
was certainly great and the tributes to it
numerous. Lowell’s personality was so winning,
and the man was so genuine, human, and lovable,
that it is difficult to speak of him in terms having
even the semblance of impartiality. Although
strong-willed and positive, not indisposed now
and then to indulge himself in the luxury of stubbornness,
he was open-minded, wholly unselfish,
kind-hearted, affectionate, and gentle; and while
he had his reserves he was democratic in all the
best senses of the word, for his democracy sprang
from the depths of his nature. Changeable in his
moods, he could be teasing, whimsical, irritating;
but when he was most mocking and perverse he
was most delightful.</p>

<p>There is something very attractive in Lowell’s
attitude toward literature and literary fame. Books
were an essential part of his life. He had mastered
that difficult art of <i>reading</i> as few men have mastered
it. He was rarely endowed as a poet and
prose-writer. And yet Lowell, the most complete
illustration we have of the literary man, showed no
inclination to magnify the importance of letters.</p>

<p>As to his individual achievements, he not only
never thought of himself more highly than he
ought to think, but was the rather inclined to place
too low an estimate on the value of his work. Self-distrust
increased with years. Nevertheless, Lowell
indulged himself in no philosophy of despair. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
had had much to be grateful for. ‘I have always
believed that a man’s fate is born with him, and
that he cannot escape from it nor greatly modify
it’ (Lowell once wrote to his friend Charles
Eliot Norton) ‘and that consequently every one
gets in the long run exactly what he deserves,
neither more nor less.’ Lowell goes on to say
that the creed is a ‘cheerful’ one; he might have
added that it is no less sensible and manly than it
is cheerful.</p>

<p>Whether he found his creed satisfactory at all
times or was always conscious that he had a creed,
we cannot know, but he could be the blithest of
fatalists when it pleased him to be.</p>

<h3 id="sec_96">III<br />

<span class="subhead">POET AND PROSE WRITER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Lowell’s</span> prose is manly, direct, varied, flexible,
generally harmonious, abounding in passages
marked by grace, beauty, and sweetness, and capable
of rising to genuine eloquence. In its overflowing
vitality and human warmth it is an adequate
expression of the man, imaging his mocking and
humorous moods no less than his deep sincerity,
his strength of purpose, and his passion. Much
of it has the confidence and ease that go with successful
improvisation. If Lowell was ‘willing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
risk the prosperity of a verse upon a lucky throw
of words,’ he was even more willing to take like
chances with his prose.</p>

<p>His thought ran easily into figurative form, and
the making of metaphor was as natural to him as
breathing. He would even amuse himself with
conceits, for he loved to play with language, to
force words into shapes he might perchance have
condemned had he found them in the work of
another. But if style is to be representative, this
playfulness, however annoying to Lowell’s critics,
is a virtue. A Lowell chastened in his English
and wholly academic would not be the Lowell we
rejoice in.</p>

<p>He practised the art of poetry in many forms
and always with success. Of everything he wrote
you might say that it had been his study, though
you might refrain from saying that ‘it had been
all in all his study.’ In other words, as we read
Lowell the question never arises whether or not
the poet is working in unfamiliar materials, but
whether he might not have given his product a
higher finish, the materials and the form remaining
the same. He was no aspirant after flawless
beauty. He wrote spontaneously and was for the
time wholly possessed by his theme. But what he
had written he had written; and if never content
with the result he at least compelled himself to be
philosophical. He made a few changes, to be sure,
but (as was said of a far greater poet) he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
correct with an afterglow of poetic inspiration, not
with a painful tinkering of the verse.</p>

<p>It is by tinkering with the verse, however (the
‘higher’ tinkering), that perfection is attained. And
he who wrote with evident ease so many lovely
and felicitous lines could as easily have bettered
lines that are wanting in finish. It was not Lowell’s
way. Too much may not be required of a man
who often felt the utmost repugnance to reading
his own writings, once they were in print.</p>

<h3 id="sec_97">IV<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>POEMS</i>, <i>THE BIGLOW PAPERS</i>, <i>FABLE FOR
CRITICS</i>, <i>VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Lowell’s</span> first poetic flights were strong-winged.
‘Threnodia,’ ‘The Sirens,’ ‘Summer Storm,’ ‘To
Perdita, Singing,’ whatever their faults, have a
richness, a melody, a freedom of structure, an almost
careless grace, that are captivating. Here was
no painful effort in production with the inevitable
result of frigidity and hardness.</p>

<p>The poet’s gift matured rapidly. There is
strength in such poems as ‘Prometheus,’ ‘Columbus,’
‘A Glance behind the Curtain,’ rare
beauty in ‘A Legend of Brittany,’ ‘Hebe,’ and
‘Rhœcus,’ a mystical power in the haunting lines
of ‘The Sower,’ passion and uplift in ‘The Present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
Crisis,’ ‘Anti-Apis,’ the lines ‘To W. L.
Garrison,’ and the ‘Ode to France,’ while in
‘An Interview with Miles Standish’ is a promise
of that satirical power which was presently to find
complete expression in <i>The Biglow Papers</i>.</p>

<p>Early in his career Lowell announced his theory
of the poet’s office, which is to inspire to high
thought and noble action, not merely to please
with pretty fancies and melodious verse. The
‘Ode,’ written in 1841, is an expression of his
poetic faith. The ethical and reforming bent in
Lowell’s character was so strong as to make it difficult
for him, true bard though he was, to look on
poetry as an art to be cultivated for itself alone.</p>

<p>Inspiriting as were stanzas like ‘The Present
Crisis,’ Lowell’s power became most effective in
the anti-slavery struggle when the outbreak of
the Mexican War led to the writing of <i>The Biglow
Papers</i>. Printed anonymously in a journal, copied
into other newspapers, the question of their authorship
much debated, these satires were at last
adjudicated to the man who wrote them, but not
until he himself had heard it demonstrated ‘in
the pauses of a concert’ that he was wholly incapable
of such a performance.</p>

<p>Of the characters of the little drama, Hosea
Biglow, the country youth, stands for the plain
common-sense of New England, opposed to the
extension of slavery whatever the means employed,
and above all by legalized murder with an accompaniment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
of drums and fifes. The Reverend
Homer Wilbur acts as ‘chorus,’ and by his learned
comments surrounds the productions of the country
muse with an atmosphere of scholarship. Birdofredom
Sawin is the clown of the little show.</p>

<p>Many finer touches have become obscure by
the lapse of time, and <i>The Biglow Papers</i> is now
provided with historical notes; but the energy,
the spirit, and the unfailing humor of the work are
perennial. Lowell was most fortunate in his verbal
felicities. Who could have foreseen that so much
danger lurked in a middle initial, or that a plain
name of the sort borne by the former senator from
Middlesex contained such comic potentialities?</p>

<p>Lowell was surprised at his own success. What
he at first thought ‘a mere fencing stick’ proved
to be a weapon. The blade was two-edged, and
the Yankees did well to fall back a little when he
lifted it against the enemy. For in writing <i>The
Biglow Papers</i> Lowell took real delight in noting
the oddities and laughing at the foibles of his own
New Englanders, a people whom he loved with
all tenderness, but to whose faults he was not in
the least blind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span></p>

<p>In 1861 the little puppets were taken out of
the box where they had lain for fifteen years and
furbished up for a new tragi-comedy. The second
series of <i>The Biglow Papers</i> was read no less eagerly
than the first had been. Quite as brilliant as their
predecessors, the later poems are more impassioned,
and in those touching on English hostility
to the North the satire is bitterly stinging.</p>

<p>While the numbers of the first series were in
course of publication Lowell produced a rhymed
primer of contemporary American literature under
the title of <i>A Fable for Critics</i>. It was an improvisation,
and therefore the buoyancy, the jovial off-hand
manner, the impudence even, were a matter
of course and all in its favor. Often penetrating
and just in his criticisms, Lowell was invariably
amusing, and in the cleverness of the rhyme and
word play quite inimitable.</p>

<p>Two months after the appearance of the <i>Fable</i>
the popular <i>Vision of Sir Launfal</i> was published.
Though undoubtedly read more for the sake of
the preludes than for the slight but touching story,
it is by no means certain that the preludes, brought
out as independent poems, could have won the
number of readers they now have. In other words,
<i>The Vision of Sir Launfal</i> has a unity which it seems
on first acquaintance to lack.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>UNDER THE WILLOWS</i>, <i>THE CATHEDRAL</i>,
<i>COMMEMORATION ODE</i>, <i>THREE MEMORIAL
POEMS</i>, <i>HEARTSEASE AND RUE</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">‘Under</span> the Willows’ is a poem of Nature in
which the poet at no time loses sight either of the
world of books or of the world of men. If he be
driven indoors by the rigors of May, he is content
to sit by his wood-fire and read what the poets
have said in praise of that inclement month. Or if
June has come and he can dream under his favorite
willows, his reveries gain a zest from the interruptions
of the tramp, ‘lavish summer’s bedesman,’ the
scissors-grinder, that grimy Ulysses of New England,
the school-children, and the road-menders,</p>

<p class="center">
Vexing Macadam’s ghost with pounded slate.<br />
</p>

<p>It is a poem of thanksgiving in which the poet
voices his gratitude for the benediction of the higher
mood and the human kindness of the lower.</p>

<p>The volume to which ‘Under the Willows’
gives its name is typical. He who prizes Lowell’s
verse will hardly be content with any selection
which does not include ‘Al Fresco,’ ‘A Winter-Evening
Hymn to my Fire,’ ‘Invita Minerva,’
‘The Dead House,’ ‘The Parting of the Ways,’
‘The Fountain of Youth,’ and ‘The Nightingale
in the Study.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span></p>

<p>Its manner of contrasting To-Day with Yesterday,
the genius that creates with the spirit that
analyzes, makes <i>The Cathedral</i> an essentially American
poem. The minster in its ‘vast repose,’</p>

<p class="center">
Silent and gray as forest-leaguered cliff,<br />
</p>

<p class="in0">must always seem a marvel to a dweller among
temples of ‘deal and paint.’ The poem is the
meditation of a New-World conservative, altogether
catholic of sympathies, who holds no less
firmly to the past because, under the fascination
of democracy, he breathes in the presence of the
‘backwoods Charlemagne’ a braver air and is conscious
of an ‘ampler manhood.’ And what, he
asks, will be the faith of this new avatar of the
Goth, what temples will the creature build? Very
beautiful, very suggestive, and in its shifting moods
entirely representative of the poet who wrote it
must this fine work always seem.</p>

<p><i>The Ode recited at the Harvard Commemoration</i>
(July 21, 1865) is Lowell’s supreme achievement
in verse. It breathes the most exalted patriotism,
a love of native land that is intense, fiery, consuming.
Though written in honor of sons of the University
who had gone to the war, the spirit of the
<i>Ode</i> is not local and particular. The poet celebrates
not individual deeds alone but the sum of
those deeds, not man but <span class="locked">manhood:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">That leap of heart whereby a people rise</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Up to a noble anger’s height,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, flamed on by the Fates, not shrink, but grow more bright,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">That swift validity in noble veins,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
    <div class="verse indent4">Of choosing danger and disdaining shame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Of being set on flame</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">By the pure fire that flies all contact base,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But wraps its chosen with angelic might,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">These are imperishable gains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Sure as the sun, medicinal as light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">These hold great futures in their lusty reins</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And certify to earth a new imperial race.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The mingling of proud humility, tenderness, and
reverence, the throbbing passion and the exultant
fervor of the concluding verses, lift this ode to a
high place in American poetry, it may be to the
highest place. To the many, however, the chief
value of <i>The Commemoration Ode</i> lies in the stanza
on Lincoln. So just as an estimate of character, so
restrained in its accents of praise, American in all
finer meanings of the word, splendid in its imagery
and poignant in the note of grief, this beautiful
tribute to the great president is final and satisfying.</p>

<p>The first of the <i>Three Memorial Poems</i> is an
‘Ode, read at the One Hundredth Anniversary of
the Fight at Concord.’</p>

<p>In the opening stanzas on Freedom the poet
strikes the notes of exultation fitting the time and
the place, then passes to those inevitable allusions
which appeal to local pride (and Lowell handles
this passage with utmost skill), draws the lesson
that must of necessity be drawn from the ‘home-spun
deeds’ of the men of old, makes Freedom
utter her warning to the men of the present, and,
no prophet of evil, closes in the triumphant spirit
in which he began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span></p>

<p>‘Under the Old Elm’ is a magnificent tribute
to a man so great that there is need of odes like
this to help us comprehend his greatness. After
calling up the scene when Washington, ‘a stranger
among strangers,’ stood beneath that legendary
tree to take command of his army, ‘all of captains,’
a motley rout, valorous deacons, selectmen, and village
heroes among others, more skilled in debating
their orders than obeying them, good fighters all,
but ‘serious drill’s despair,’—the poet chants
those beautiful lines in which is drawn the distinction
between ‘Nation’ and ‘Country.’ The one
is fashioned of computable things, good each in its
kind and important in its <span class="locked">place:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

It is a thoughtful, nobly eloquent, and poetically
beautiful characterization of the great Virginian,
and appropriately closes with a fine apostrophe
to the historic Commonwealth from which Washington
sprang.</p>

<p>The ‘Ode for the Fourth of July, 1876,’ though
not lacking in forceful lines and fine imagery, is
the least happy of the three poems. The questioning
and critical mood is prominent. But the
spirit of confidence prevails and is voiced in the
invocation with which the ode concludes.</p>

<p>Various notes are touched in the collection of
eighty-eight poems to which its author gave the
title of <i>Heartsease and Rue</i>. Here are verses new
and old, grave and gay, satirical, humorous, sentimental,
and elegiac, epigrams, inscriptions, lyrics,
poems of occasion, sonnets, epistles, and, chief
among them, the ode written on hearing the news
of the death of Agassiz. Whether, as has been asserted,
‘this poem takes its place with the few great
elegies in our language, gives a hand to “Lycidas”
and to “Thyrsis,”’ is a question to be decided by
the suffrages of many good critics, rather than by
the dictum of one. There is no doubt, however,
that by virtue of its human quality, depth of personal
feeling, sincerity in the accent of bereavement,
and felicity of phrase, the ‘Agassiz’ will always
stand in the first rank of Lowell’s greater verse.</p>

<h3 id="sec_99">VI<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>FIRESIDE TRAVELS</i>, <i>MY STUDY WINDOWS</i>,
<i>AMONG MY BOOKS</i>, <i>LATEST LITERARY
ESSAYS</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><i>Fireside Travels</i> is so entertaining a book as to
make one wish that Lowell had chronicled more
of his journeyings at home and abroad in the same
amusing style. Two of the six essays—‘Cambridge
Thirty Years Ago’ and ‘A Moosehead
Journal’—take the form of letters addressed to
the author’s friend, ‘the Edelmann Storg’ (W. W.
Story). The others are grouped under the general
title of ‘Leaves from my Journal in Italy
and Elsewhere.’</p>

<p>One spirit animates the pages of this book,—a
love of plain people, homely adventures, everyday
sights and sounds. In a half-serious way (as
if to show that he knows how to ‘do’ a tempest
in the mountains or an illumination of St. Peter’s)
Lowell throws in a number of unconventional
passages on entirely conventional themes. But
the strength of the book lies in the sympathetic
and humorous accounts of that protean animal
Man, who, whether he showed himself in the
guise of a denizen of Old Cambridge, or of Uncle
Zeb, who had been ‘to the ‘Roostick war,’ or of
the Chief Mate of the packet ship, or of Leopoldo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
the Italian guide, was more interesting to
Lowell than any other object of his study.</p>

<p>Together with <i>Fireside Travels</i> may be read
‘My Garden Acquaintance’ and ‘A Good Word
for Winter,’ from <i>My Study Windows</i>, gossipy
papers on Nature by one who looked on ‘a great
deal of the modern sentimentalism about Nature
as a mark of disease ... one more symptom
of the general liver complaint.’ The sincerity of
Lowell’s love of birds, beasts, flowers, trees, the sky
and the landscape, admits of no question. Yet he
approached Nature more or less through literature,
as was becoming in a man brought up on White’s
<i>Selborne</i>; and he seems his characteristic self when,
having pulled a chair out under a tree, he sits there
with a volume of Chaucer in his hands, looking up
from the page now and then to watch his feathered
neighbors, and make wise and humorous comments
on their doings.</p>

<p><i>Among My Books</i> is a volume of literary and
historical studies, six in number, entitled respectively,
‘Dryden,’ ‘Witchcraft,’ ‘Shakespeare
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Once More,’ ‘New England Two Centuries Ago,’</span><br />
‘Lessing,’ ‘Rousseau and the Sentimentalists.’ All
are in Lowell’s best manner, and the ‘Dryden’
and ‘Shakespeare’ are particularly fine examples of
those leisurely, stimulating, and always brilliant
literary studies which this scholar knew so well
how to write.</p>

<p>Of the thirteen papers in <i>My Study Windows</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
that on ‘Abraham Lincoln’<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> and the one ‘On a
Certain Condescension in Foreigners’ have a political
bearing; those on ‘A Great Public Character’
(Josiah Quincy) and ‘Emerson the Lecturer’
are studies in personality; the ‘Library of Old
Authors’ is an exercise in textual criticism, a merciless
arraignment of certain unfortunate editors;
the ‘Carlyle,’ ‘James Gates Percival,’ ‘Thoreau,’
‘Swinburne’s Tragedies,’ ‘Chaucer,’ and ‘Pope’
are studies in literary history and interpretation.</p>

<p><i>Among My Books</i>, ‘second series,’ contains five
essays. More than a third of the volume is devoted
to a study of ‘Dante,’ elaborate and exhaustive—as
the word ‘exhaustive’ might be used in
speaking of an essay not of a book. Then follows
a most sympathetic essay on ‘Spenser,’ together
with papers on ‘Milton,’ ‘Wordsworth,’ and
‘Keats.’</p>

<p>Of Lowell’s critical writings as a whole it may
be said that better reading does not exist; and
among the virtues of these essays is their length.
Lowell would have been ill at ease in the limits of
three or four thousand words too often imposed
by the editors of our current magazines. He might
even have been scornful of a public taste which
dictated to editors to dictate to their contributors
limits so narrow. Writing from the fulness of a
well-stored mind, he liked room in which to display<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
his thought. Having much to say, he did not
scruple to take time to say it; but the time always
goes quickly. He understood perfectly the art
of beguiling one into forgetting the hours as they
pass.</p>

<p>These essays, so rich in critical suggestiveness,
abound in matter-of-fact knowledge. We read for
information and get it. Lowell shares with us the
wealth of his acquaintance with books. His manner
is unostentatious. Macaulay staggers us with
his array of facts and his range of allusion. We
are overwhelmed, intellectually cowed by the display
of knowledge. Lowell too astonishes, but
only after a while. Macaulay declaims at his reader,
Lowell converses with him. All is so easy, good-humored,
and witty, that the reader for a moment
labors under the mistake of supposing that he is
being instructed less than he would like. Later
he begins to count up his mental gains, and is surprised
at the display they make.</p>

<p>Another obvious source of pleasure is the felicity
of expression. Lowell had the courage of his
cleverness. Brilliancy was natural to him. He
defended the practice of piquant phrasing, maintaining
that a thought is not wanting in depth
because it is strikingly put. Doubtless he loved
an ingenious turn for its own sake, but it would
be difficult to find an instance of his making a
display of verbal vivacity to conceal poverty of
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span></p>

<p>These pages bear constant witness to Lowell’s
passion for books, a passion too genuine and deep-seated
to admit of any doubt on his part of the
worth of literature. He had none of Emerson’s
scepticism, who held that if people would only
think, they might do without books. The dullest
proser and most leaden-winged poet could not
make Lowell despair.</p>

<p>A number of essays display no little of the severity
which we have learned to associate with
reviewing after the manner of Jeffrey and Lockhart.
Yet these caustic passages were written by
a man who said of himself that he had ‘to fight
the temptation to be too good-natured.’ Priggishness
was as absurd to him in scholarship and
letters as elsewhere, and he never lost a chance to
give it a touch of the whip. Happily there is little
of this. Lowell was almost uniformly urbane, gracious,
reasonable.</p>

<p>If his subject was a great one Lowell treated it
in a great way; if circumscribed and provincial he
enlarged its boundaries—as in the essay on ‘James
Gates Percival,’ where a subject of small intrinsic
worth becomes a study of the American literary
mind at one of its periods of acute self-consciousness,
useful historically and tending to present-day
edification. Needless to say, Lowell enjoyed handling
this topic. He liked to satirize the early
American authors and critics, solemn and important
over their great work of inaugurating a New-World<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
literature and quite convinced that, since
‘that little driblet of the Avon had succeeded in
producing William Shakespeare,’ something unusual
was to be expected of the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>Although Lowell’s standing as a critic rests on
such writings as his ‘Dryden,’ ‘Shakespeare,’
‘Chaucer,’ ‘Spenser,’ ‘Pope,’ and ‘Dante,’ the
amateur of good literature cannot afford to neglect
anything to which this fine scholar put his hand.</p>

<p>The later volumes contain some of his most
illuminating criticism (notably in the ‘Fielding,’
‘Don Quixote,’ ‘Gray,’ ‘Walton,’ and ‘Landor’),
and his style seems the perfection of ease and
suppleness. Doubtless it is negligent now and
then, but always with the winning negligence of a
master in the difficult art of expression.</p>

<h3 id="sec_100">VII<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>POLITICAL ADDRESSES AND PAPERS</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><i>The Anti-Slavery Papers</i> consists of editorial articles
reprinted from ‘The Pennsylvania Freeman,’
and ‘The Anti-Slavery Standard.’<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> Witty,
ironical, and pungent, these fugitive leaves are of
value for the light they throw on the history of the
struggle maintained by the Abolitionists against
their powerful enemies both in the North and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
the South, as well as for the idea they give of the
militant Lowell at a time when to conviction of
the justness of the cause for which he fought was
added a measure of joyousness in the mere act of
fighting.</p>

<p>Of greater significance is the volume of <i>Political
Essays</i>, twelve papers written at intervals between
1858 and 1866. Designed for the most part to
serve an immediate purpose, and betraying in every
page the writer’s depth of feeling, intensity of patriotism,
and strong but not bigoted Northern convictions,
these essays, by their acuteness of insight,
balanced judgment, admirable temper, and wealth
of allusion, as well as by their literary flavor and
their occasional eloquence, hold a permanent place
not only among Lowell’s best writings but among
the best of the innumerable political papers called
out by the Civil War.</p>

<p>Of Lowell’s later political utterances none is more
notable than the address on ‘Democracy,’ delivered
at Birmingham in 1884, a cleverly phrased and
thoughtful speech in which the American minister
defended the democratic idea with logic as adroit
as it was sound. That the source of American
democracy was the English constitution must have
been news to a part at least of his English audience.
It was a happy thought of Lowell’s to show how
stable democracy might be as a system of government.
He made the argument from expediency,
that ‘it is cheaper in the long run to lift men up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
than to hold them down, and that a ballot in their
hands is less dangerous to society than a sense of
wrong in their heads.’ He would not have been
Lowell had he not also shown that a democracy
has its finer instincts, or failed to recognize the fact
that as an experiment in the art of government it
must stand or fall by its own merits. And the
whole address is strongly optimistic, in its insistence
that ‘those who have the divine right to
govern will be found to govern in the end.’</p>

<p>The address on ‘The Place of the Independent
in Politics’ supplements the Birmingham address.
As Lowell before an English audience had dwelt
on ‘the good points and favorable aspect of democracy,’
so before a home audience he discussed
its weak points and its dangers. He thought the
system would bear investigation. At no time did
he labor under the mistake of supposing that democracy
was a contrivance which ran of its own
accord. Parties there must be and politicians to
look after them, but it is no less essential that
there should be somebody to look after the politicians.
The address is a plea for unselfishness in
political action.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Admirers of Lowell find it easy to believe that
of all American makers of verse he had the most
of what is called inspiration. With less catholic
tastes he might have become a greater poet and
would undoubtedly have been a finer artist. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
granting that it was a matter of choice, and that
Lowell had elected to make mastery in verse (with
all the sacrifices involved) the object of his life, how
serious then would have been the loss to criticism
and to politics. The Lowell we know, with his
extraordinary mental vivacity, his grasp of a multitude
of interests that make for culture, is surely
a more engaging figure than the hypothetical
Lowell of purely poetical achievement.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Walter Whitman</span> (commonly known as
Walt) was born at West Hills, a village in
Huntington Township, Long Island, on May 31,
1819. He was a son of Walter Whitman, a carpenter
and house-builder, who followed his trade
chiefly in New York and Brooklyn. The Long
Island Whitmans claim descent from the Reverend
Zechariah Whitman, who came to America in
1635, and settled at Milford, Connecticut. Zechariah’s
son Joseph crossed the Sound ‘sometime
before 1660,’ and may have been the original purchaser
of the farm where successive generations of
his descendants lived, and where the poet was born.</p>

<p>Blended with this English blood was that of
a line of Dutch ancestors. Whitman’s mother,
Louisa Van Velsor, daughter of Cornelius Van<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
Velsor of Cold Spring Harbor, was of ‘the old
race of the Netherlands, so deeply grafted on
Manhattan Island and in Kings and Queens
counties.’ The Van Velsors were noted for their
horses, and in her youth Louisa was a daring rider.</p>

<p>Whitman’s education was such as a Brooklyn
public school of the early Thirties afforded. After
a little experience as an office-boy he learned to set
type. To vary the monotony of life at the composing-case
he taught in country schools or worked
at farming. Occasionally he dabbled in literature,
publishing tales and essays in the ‘Democratic
Review.’ In 1839 he started at Huntington a
‘weekly’ paper, the ‘Long Islander,’ publishing it
at such intervals as pleased him best. For a time
he edited the ‘Brooklyn Eagle’ (1848), diverting
himself in the intervals of journalistic work with
‘an occasional shy at “poetry.”’</p>

<p>Nomadic by instinct and of a curious and inquiring
turn of mind, Whitman, accompanied by his
brother Jeff, made ‘a leisurely journey and working
expedition’ through the Middle States, down
the Ohio and Mississippi to New Orleans, returning
in the same deliberate manner by the Great
Lakes, Lower Canada, and the Hudson. During
his stay in New Orleans (1849–50) he was an editorial
writer on the’ Crescent.’ In Brooklyn (1850–51)
he edited and published a paper called ‘The
Freeman,’ then for three or four years he built
and sold small houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span></p>

<p>The first edition of the extraordinary and notorious
<i>Leaves of Grass</i> (for which Whitman himself
helped to set the type) appeared in 1855, and was
described by Emerson to Carlyle as ‘a nondescript
monster, which yet had terrible eyes and buffalo
strength, and was indisputably American.’ An
enlarged edition appeared in 1856, to be followed
by yet a third in 1860. The sales were slow and
the reviews for the most part hostile and often
abusive.</p>

<p>There was some discussion in the Whitman
family over the merits of the book. The poet’s
brother, George Whitman, said in after years: ‘I remember
mother comparing Hiawatha to Walt’s,
and the one seemed to us pretty much the same
muddle as the other. Mother said if Hiawatha
was poetry, perhaps Walt’s was.’<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>In 1862 George Whitman was wounded at the
first battle of Fredericksburg. Walt went immediately
to the front to care for him. His sympathies
were enlisted by the sight of the misery on
every hand and he became a volunteer army nurse,
serving for three years in the hospitals in Washington.
‘He saved many lives’ was the testimony of
a surgeon who had observed Whitman at his work.
But his powerful physique broke under the strain,
and a severe illness followed.</p>

<p>When he recovered, a clerkship was given him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
in the Department of the Interior; he was presently
removed on the charge (it is said) of having
written an indecent book.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> A place was immediately
found for him in the Attorney General’s office,
and this place he held until he was stricken by partial
paralysis early in 1873.</p>

<p>From 1873 until his death Whitman lived in
Camden, New Jersey, at first making his home
with his soldier brother, George, later setting up
an establishment of his own at 328 Mickle Street.
He never married, having an ‘overmastering passion
for entire freedom, unconstraint; I had
an instinct against forming ties that would bind
me.’</p>

<p>The following list of Whitman’s writings conveys
no idea of the interest attaching to them as
bibliographical curiosities, but will perhaps answer
the needs of the student.</p>

<p><i>Leaves of Grass</i>, 1855 (second edition, 1856;
third, 1860–61; fourth, 1867; fifth, 1871); <i>Walt
Whitman’s Drum-Taps</i> and its <i>Sequel</i>, 1865–66;
<i>Democratic Vistas</i>, 1871; <i>After All not to Create
Only</i>, 1871; <i>Passage to India</i>, 1871; <i>As a Strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
Bird on Pinions Free</i>, 1872; <i>Memoranda during the
War</i>, 1875–76; <i>Two Rivulets</i> (prose and verse),
1876; <i>Specimen Days and Collect</i>, 1882–83; <i>November
Boughs</i> (prose and verse), 1888; <i>Good-Bye My
Fancy</i>, 1891; <i>Calamus: A Series of Letters ... to
a young friend (Peter Doyle)</i>, 1897; <i>The Wound
Dresser</i>, 1898.</p>

<p>The storm of opposition which greeted Whitman’s
earlier work gradually subsided, and he
became a notable figure among contemporary men
of letters. He was invited to read original poems
on public occasions, such as the opening of the
American Institute (1871), the Commencement
at Dartmouth College (1872), and the Commencement
at Tufts College (1874). In later years he
enjoyed literary canonization in a small way. Many
pilgrims visited the bard in his unpoetical house
in Camden. Worshippers came from England to
pay him homage and incidentally to rail at Americans
for neglecting one of their few geniuses,
stolidly ignoring the fact that they themselves had
neglected not a few of their many geniuses. And
before Walt Whitman died (March 26, 1892) he
had tasted some of the delights of fame.</p>

<h3 id="sec_102">II<br />

<span class="subhead">THE GROWTH OF A REPUTATION</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Being</span> prejudiced in favor of metre and rhyme,
probably from long experience of verse written
in the conservative way, an old-fashioned world
did not welcome <i>Leaves of Grass</i> with enthusiasm.
A few discerning spirits saw in Whitman
the promise of mighty things. Emerson greeted
him ‘at the beginning of a great career;’ but
when the poet had these words from a private
letter stamped in gilt capitals on the cover of his
next volume, Emerson (it is thought) was a little
dismayed.</p>

<p>Not only did the form of the poems offend, but
the content as well. There were lines calculated to
disconcert even such people as were not, in their
own opinion, prudish. The lines were comparatively
few in number, but they were there in unabashed
nakedness, and <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, it may
be assumed, often went on a top shelf instead of
on the sitting-room table along with innocuous
poets like Tennyson and Longfellow.</p>

<p>Neglect and abuse raised up for Whitman in
time a small battalion of champions, fierce, determined,
uncompromising, militant. Among them
were men whose attitude towards literature was
catholic and liberal. For the most part they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
Whitmanites, hot as lovers, quarrelsome as bullies,
biting their thumbs at every passer-by.</p>

<p>Literary championship has one good effect: it
keeps the public, gorged with novels of the day,
from quite going to sleep. There is always a
chance that some open-minded reader will be
stirred by the clash of critical arms to look into the
affair that is causing so great a pother. Better to
be advertised by the crowd of swashbucklers who
clattered about wearing Whitman’s colors than not
to be advertised at all. The public concluded that
a man who could inspire loyalty like this must be
worth while. Whitman’s audience and influence
grew. The bodyguard pretty much lost the power
to see virtue in any poet save its own, but it had
succeeded in arresting public attention.</p>

<p>In 1876 a number of English admirers subscribed
freely to the new edition of Whitman’s
writings and garnished their guineas with comfortable
words. The poet was sick, poor, discouraged,
and by his own grateful testimony this show of
interest put new heart into him—‘saved my life,’
he said. It might well have had that effect, since
no less names than those of Tennyson, Ruskin,
Rossetti, and Lord Houghton were to be found
in the list of subscribers. Even Robert Buchanan,
who assailed with virulence the author of ‘Jenny,’
had no scruple in bidding God speed to the author
of the ‘Song of Myself’ and ‘Children of Adam.’</p>

<p>A momentary set-back occurred in 1882, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
Whitman’s Boston publisher was threatened with
prosecution. ‘The official mind’ declared that it
would be content if two poems were suppressed,
the poems in question resembling in some particulars
the stories an English editor omitted from
the <i>Thousand-and-One Nights</i>, on the ground that
they were ‘interesting only to Arabs and old gentlemen.’
Whitman refused to omit so much as a
word, and the book was transferred to a Philadelphia
publishing house.</p>

<p>After 1882 Whitman found himself able to
publish freely and without the fear of the district
attorney before his eyes. Since his death he has
been accorded a niche in the American literary
pantheon, if we may believe the critics, who now
treat his work with the confidence which marks
their attitude towards Lowell or Longfellow.</p>

<h3 id="sec_103">III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE WRITER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Unless</span> indeed, as some maintain, Whitman got
the suggestion of a rhapsodical form from the
once famous <i>Poems of Ossian</i>, he may be said to
have invented his own ‘verse.’ These unrhymed
and unmetred chants give a pleasure the degree
of which is largely determined by the reader’s willingness
to allow Whitman to speak in his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
manner and wholly without reference to time-honored
modes of poetic expression. Such receptivity
of mind is indispensable.</p>

<p>Whitman called his rhapsodies ‘poems,’ ‘chants,’
or ‘songs’ indifferently; the last term was a favorite
with him, in later editions; he has a ‘Song
of the Open Road,’ a ‘Song of the Broad-Axe,’
a ‘Song for Occupations,’ a ‘Song of the Rolling
Earth,’ a ‘Song of Myself,’ a ‘Song of the Exposition,’
a ‘Song of the Redwood-Tree,’ ‘Songs
of Parting,’ and yet more songs. Obviously he
used the word without reference to the traditional
meaning. Says Whitman: ‘... it is not on <i>Leaves
of Grass</i> distinctively as <i>literature</i>, or a specimen
thereof, that I feel to dwell, or advance claims.
No one will get at my verses who insists upon
viewing them as a literary performance, or attempt
at such performance, or as aiming mainly toward
art or æstheticism.’ Holding as he did that so
long as ‘the States’ were dominated by the poetic
ideals of the Old World they would stop short
of first-class nationality, his own practice necessarily
involved getting rid, first of all, of the forms in
which poetry had hitherto found expression.</p>

<p>That the structure of Whitman’s rhapsodies is
determined by some law cannot be questioned.
After one has read these pieces many times, he
will find himself instinctively expecting a certain
cadence. The change of a word spoils it, the introduction
of a rhyme is intolerable. They who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
are versed in Whitman’s style can probably detect
at once a variation from his best manner. That
his peculiarities in the arrangement of words are
very subtile is plain from a glance at the numerous
and generally unsuccessful parodies of <i>Leaves
of Grass</i>. The parodists have not grasped Whitman’s
secret. Merely to write in irregular lines
and begin each line with a capital is to represent
only the obvious and superficial side. Whitman
is inimitable even in his catalogues. The ninth
stanza of ‘I Sing the Body Electric’ reads like
an extract from a papal anathema, but it has the
Whitmanesque quality; no one can reproduce it.
The imitations of Whitman are always amusing
and often ingenious, but they are not, like Lewis
Carroll’s ‘Three Voices,’ true parodies.</p>

<p>Whitman probably did not know every step of
the process by which he attained his results. He
was a poet who created his own laws and had no
philosophy of poetic form to expound.</p>

<h3 id="sec_104">IV<br />

<span class="subhead"><i>LEAVES OF GRASS</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">A first</span> impression of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> is of uncouthness
and blatancy, together with something
yet more objectionable. The writer would seem to
be a man fond of shocking what are called the proprieties,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
so frank and egregious is his animalism,
so overpowering his self-assertiveness.</p>

<p>The author of <i>Laus Veneris</i> accuses Whitman
of indecency. The charge is a grave one and emanates
from a high source. The distinguished English
poet admits that there are few subjects which
‘may not be treated with success;’ but the treatment
is everything. This is ‘a radical and fundamental
truth of criticism.’ Whitman’s indecency
then consists not so much in the choice of the
subject as in the awkwardness of the touch. Or as
Swinburne puts it with characteristic emphasis:
‘Under the dirty paws of a harper whose plectrum
is a muck-rake any tune will become a chaos of
discords, though the motive of the tune should be
the first principle of nature—the passion of man
for woman or the passion of woman for man.’</p>

<p>But along with that first impression of Whitman’s
verse as the product of a strong, coarse
nature, wilfully brutal at times, comes the no less
marked impression that the man is serenely honest,
and animated by a benevolence which helps
to relieve the brutality of its most repulsive features.
At all events, Whitman is what Carlyle
might have described as ‘one of the palpablest of
Facts in this miserable world where so much is
Invertebrate and Phantasmal.’ Whether we like
him or not, Whitman is by no means one of those
neutral literary persons who are in danger of being
overlooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span></p>

<p>In fact, the word ‘literary’ as applied to the
author of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> is singularly inept.
Whitman is not literary, that is to say he is not a
product of libraries. No meek and reverent follower
of poets gone before is this. ‘He has no
literary ancestor, he is an ancestor himself’—or
at least takes the attitude of one. He is a son
of earth, a genuine autochthon, naked and not
ashamed, noisy, vociferous, naïvely delighted with
the music of his own raucous voice.</p>

<p>In that first great rhapsody, ‘Poem of Walt
Whitman, an American,’<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> we have the most
characteristic expression of his genius. He proclaims
his interest in all that concerns mankind—not
a cold, objective interest merely, he is himself
a part of the mighty pageant of life, sympathetic
with every phase of joy and sorrow, identifying
himself with high and low, finding nothing mean
or contemptible. He states the idea with a hundred
variations, returns upon it, sets it in new
lights, enforces it. Every phenomenon of human
life teaches this lesson. Every pleasure, every
grief, every experience small or great concerns him.
He identifies himself with the life of the most miserable
of <span class="locked">creatures:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent28">I am possess’d!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Embody all presences outlaw’d or suffering,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See myself in prison shaped like another man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And feel the dull unintermitted pain.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span></p>
<p>He carries the process of identification too far
at times, leading to results that would be disgusting
were they not laughably grotesque. Whitman
makes no reservations on the score of taste.</p>

<p>This doctrine of the unity of being and experience
is comprehensive, not limited to human life;
the brute and insentient existences are included as
well. For a statement of Whitman’s creed take
the poem beginning: ‘There was a child went
forth.’ If a busy man were ambitious to know
something about Whitman’s poetry and had only
a minimum of time to give to the subject (like
Franklin when he undertook to post up on revealed
religion), one would not hesitate to commend
to his notice this poem as one of the first to
be read. The theme is contained in the four introductory
lines. All that follows is an amplification
of a single <span class="locked">thought:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There was a child went forth every day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the first object he look’d upon, that object he became,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part of the day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or for many years or stretching cycles of years.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Every object grows incorporate with the child,
an essential inseparable part of him,—the early
lilacs, the noisy brood of the barnyard, people,
home, the family usages, doubts even (doubts
‘whether that which appears is so, or is it all
flashes and specks?’), the streets, the shops,
the crowd surging along, shadows and mist, and
boats and waves,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The strata of color’d clouds, the long bar of maroon-tint away solitary by itself, the spread of purity it lies motionless in,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The horizon’s edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt marsh and shore mud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These became part of that child who went forth every day, and who now goes, and will always go forth every day.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The idea has another setting in ‘Salut au
Monde,’ Walt Whitman’s brotherly wave of the
hand to the whole world. It is a vision of kingdoms
and nations, comprehensive, detailed; it is
geography and the catalogue raised to the dignity
of eloquence. Latitude and longitude and the hot
equator ‘banding the bulge of the earth’ acquire
new meaning in this strange chant. The poet hears
the myriad sound of the life of all <span class="locked">peoples:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I hear the Arab muezzin calling from the top of the mosque,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I hear the Christian priests at the altars of their churches, I hear the responsive bass and soprano,</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I hear the rhythmic myths of the Greeks, and the strong legends of the Romans,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I hear the tale of the divine life and the bloody death of the beautiful God the Christ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I hear the Hindoo teaching his favorite pupil the loves, wars, adages, transmitted safely to this day from poets who wrote three thousand years ago.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The mountains, the rivers, the stormy seas, the
pageant of fallen empires and ancient religions,
of cities and plains, all sweep past in this survey
of the world. And to all, <span class="locked">salutation:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My spirit has pass’d in compassion and determination around the whole earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have look’d for equals and lovers and found them ready for me in all lands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I think some divine rapport has equalized me with them.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span></p>
<p>The ‘Song of the Open Road,’ which may very
well be read next, is a challenge to a larger life
than that which conventions, and modes, and
common social habits will <span class="locked">permit:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">From this hour I ordain myself loos’d of limits and imaginary lines,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Going where I list, my own master total and absolute,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Listening to others, considering well what they say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that would hold me.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is no journey of ease to which the poet invites
his followers; he offers none of the ‘old
smooth <span class="locked">prizes:’—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My call is the call of battle, I nourish active rebellion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He going with me must go well arm’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, angry enemies, desertion.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Notable among Whitman’s best poems, and
most important to an understanding of him, is the
‘Song of the Answerer,’ that is to say, of the
Poet. He it is who puts things in their right <span class="locked">relations:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Every existence has its idiom, every thing has an idiom and a tongue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The Answerer is quite other than the Singer—he
is more powerful, his existence is more significant,
his words are of weight and <span class="locked">insight:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark, but the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His insight and power encircle things and the human race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human race.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In that fine rhapsody ‘By Blue Ontario’s
Shore’ Whitman restates his doctrine while applying
it to the need of his own <span class="locked">America:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Rhymes and rhymers pass away, poems distill’d from poems pass away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and leave ashes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make but the soil of literature,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">America justifies itself, give it time, no disguise can deceive it or conceal from it, it is impassive enough,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">(The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr’d till his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb’d it.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘By Blue Ontario’s Shore,’ from which these
lines are taken, is a chant for America. Patriotism
is Whitman’s darling theme. Love of native land,
confidence in democracy, the self-sufficiency of
the Republic and the certainty of its future—with
these ideas and with this spirit his verse is
charged to the <span class="locked">full:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>

<p>One of the most magnificent of Whitman’s
patriotic chants is that known by its opening line,
‘As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free.’ He would
be a hardened sceptic who, after reading these
superb and uplifting verses, found himself still
unconverted to some portion of the gospel of
poetry as preached by Walt Whitman. There is
no resisting the man here, or when he shows his
power in pieces like ‘Proud Music of the Storm,’
‘Passage to India,’ ‘The Mystic Trumpeter,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
‘With Husky-Haughty Lips, O Sea!’ ‘To the
Man-of-War-Bird,’ ‘Song of the Universal,’ and
‘Chanting the Square Deific.’</p>

<p>Admirable, even wonderful, as these verses are,
it may be after all that the little volume called
<i>Drum-Taps</i> (together with its <i>Sequel</i>) is Whitman’s
best gift to the literature of his country.
Vivid pictures of battle-field, camp, and hospital,
they are not to be forgotten by him who has once
looked on them. The ‘Prelude,’ ‘Cavalry Crossing
a Ford,’ ‘By the Bivouac’s Fitful Flame,’ ‘The
Dresser,’ the impressive ‘Vigil strange I kept on
the field one night,’ and the no less striking ‘A
march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,’
together with ‘As toilsome I wander’d
Virginia’s woods,’ the ‘Hymn of Dead Soldiers,’
and ‘Spirit whose Work is Done,’—these and
many more have accomplished for Whitman’s
reputation what the ‘Song of Myself’ and kindred
poems could not.</p>

<p>In <i>Drum-Taps</i> appeared the tributes to Lincoln,
‘O Captain, my Captain,’ and the great lament
beginning ‘When lilacs last in the dooryard
bloom’d.’ Here the poet rises to his supreme
height. For pathos and tenderness, for beauty of
phrase, nobility of thought, and a grand yet simple
manner this threnody is indeed worthy of the
praise bestowed on it by those critics whose praise
is most to be desired.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<span class="subhead"><i>SPECIMEN DAYS AND COLLECT</i></span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">Whitman’s</span> prose in the definitive edition makes
a stout volume of more than five hundred closely
printed pages. The title, <i>Specimen Days and Collect</i>,
gives an imperfect hint of the contents. Here
are extracts from journals kept through twenty
years. Many bear a resemblance to Hugo’s
<i>Choses Vues</i>. Largely autobiographical and reminiscent,
they are vivid, picturesque, and far better
in their haphazard way than a good deal of formal
‘literature.’ Here are reprints of prefaces to the
several editions of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, together with
papers on Burns, Tennyson, and Shakespeare, a
lecture on Lincoln, a paper on American national
literature, and yet more ‘diary-notes’ and ‘splinters.’
He who loves to browse in a book will
find the volume of Whitman’s prose made to his
hand. The prose is of high importance to an
understanding of what, oddly enough, his poetry
imperfectly reveals—Whitman’s character. To
know the man as he really was we must read
<i>Specimen Days and Collect</i>.</p>

<span class="subhead">WHITMAN’S CHARACTER</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="secfirstword">There</span> is a certain uncanny quality in parts of
Whitman’s verse. The reiteration of particular
phrases and words awakens an uncomfortable feeling,
a suspicion of not-to-be-named queernesses,
to use no plainer term. The constant translation
of conceptions of ideal love into fleshly symbols
moves the reader to irreverence if not to disgust.
Whitman’s favorite image of bearded ‘comrades’
who kiss when they meet, and who take long walks
with their arms around each other’s necks, may be
‘nonchalant’ but it is not agreeable. Somehow it
does not seem as if the doctrine of the brotherhood
of man gained many supporters by so singular
a method of propagandism.</p>

<p>When from time to time Whitman talked with
Peter Doyle about his books, Doyle would say:
‘I don’t know what you are trying to get at.’<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>
It is an ironical comment on the great preacher of
the needs and virtues of the average man that his
poetry should have been handed over to the keeping
of those whose jaded taste makes them hanker
after the bizarre, after anything that breeds discussion,
anything demanding interpretation and
defence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span></p>

<p>Yet no one doubts the sincerity of these faithful
followers. Whitmanites really like Whitman
albeit they protest too much. It is difficult to
read him and not like him. Unfortunately the
many find it impossible to read him. Whitman
prepares his feast, throws open his doors, and bids
all enter who will. A few come and by their shrill
volubility make it seem as if the dining-room were
crowded. The majority do not trouble to cross
the threshold. They have heard that the host
serves queer dishes; it has even been reported that
he is a cannibal.</p>

<p>This, or something very like it, has been Whitman’s
fate. A taste for his work must be acquired.
He is the idol of cliques and societies, and a meaningless
name to the great people whom he loved,
whose virtues he chanted with confident fervor,
and in whom he trusted unreservedly.</p>

<p>Poetry so egoistic might be supposed to reveal
the man. Strangely enough, Whitman’s poetry,
despite the heavy and continued accentuation of
the personal note, gives but a partial, a quite imperfect
view of the man himself. Whitman tells
us so emphatically what he <i>thinks</i> that we are at a
loss to know what he himself <i>is</i>. The great Shakespeare,
according to popular opinion, is veiled from
us through his extraordinary impersonality. Whitman
accomplishes a not dissimilar end by diametrically
opposite means; he hides himself by
over obtrusion of the personal element. The case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
is not so common as to be undeserving of study.
As a method it has many drawbacks.</p>

<p>Whitman has suffered at his own hands. The
egoistic manner, indispensable to his theory and
not to be taken with literalness, is nevertheless a
stumbling-block. Instruct themselves how they
will that in saying ‘I’ the poet also means ‘You,’
that whatever Walt Whitman claims for himself
he also claims for every one else, readers somehow
lose hold of the thought and are amazed and
angered by the poet’s monstrous vanity.</p>

<p>To this feeling the prose writings are an antidote.
We learn in a few pages how simple-minded,
patient, and lovable this man really was;
how reverent of genius, how free from envy, undisturbed
by suffering, ill-repute, and delayed
hopes. There was something at once pathetic and
noble in his patience, in his magnificent repose and
stability. The impersonal character of the tree
and the rock, which he admired so much, became
in a measure his. He bided his time. The success
of other poets awakened no jealousy. He never
called names, never picked flaws in the work of
his brother bards. The better we know him the
more dignified and lofty his figure becomes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Transcribers_Notes">Transcriber’s Notes</h2>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made
consistent when a predominant preference was found
in the original book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced
quotation marks were remedied when the change was
obvious, and otherwise left unbalanced.</p>

<p>The index was not checked for proper alphabetization
or correct page references.</p>

<p>Transcriber removed redundant chapter headings.</p>

<p>Lists of reference materials, originally printed at
the bottom of the first page of each biography,
have been moved to just after the chapter
headings and labelled as “References:” by the
Transcriber.</p>

<p>Footnotes, originally printed at the bottoms of
pages, have been renumbered, collected,
moved to the ends of their chapters, and labelled
as “Footnotes:” by the Transcriber.</p>
